My background is that i graduated from college a year ago and landed an okay-ish job. It's enough to pay the bills and slowly build up savings. I've primarily been saving for my first car and a 6 month emergency fund, both of which I now have the money to afford.

,povertyfinance,"Having been raised in poverty my realization was that having no money had simply left behind nothing but poor financial advice.  Remember your Mum is your Mum, not an accountant or qualified financial advisor.  This means even advice that is simply good may not be factually practical!  In fact looking back most advice was in it's simplest black and white form.  

For example I never got pocket money, I usually only saw money when there was an item I needed to buy of that amount.  What am I learning?

Financially I was learning nothing other than what was in my hand was for spending on what I what I wanted.  The reason for this was 'not being able to afford' to give me pocket money.  Which all in is fine, as a parent now though if pocket money is not viable perhaps as a parent you could consider taking the cost of the item and increasing it by a percentage.  Even if it's 3%.  Encourage the 3% to go in to a savings account or jar for your child and let them watch it grow.  I never had or was encouraged to save ever and it's likely the reason I struggled to save as a young adult.  

When at college I was encouraged to take out a student loan by a friend.  I refused as on the black and white principle of my financial upbringing was that LOANS ARE BAD.....CREDIT CARDS ARE BAD.  Again, perfectly true statements.  I continued to refuse loans and credit in to my adult life as it was BAD.  However, here another problem lies.  I'm still living in poverty and starting to work which is great but I can't get ANYTHING because I don't have debt - I can afford money for improving my lifestyle but I have no credit history therefore I cannot get finance contract for a phone.  I'm stuck with costly Pay As You Go.  The internet and it's benefits are really taking off (yes I'm old ok) but credit cards offer online purchase security, but I can't get a credit card so I'm vulnerable if use my debit.  In this scenario encouraging only one credit card to your young adult for online use and start building credit history.  If they mess it up they will learn and because you've taught them how to save for 18 years they have bail out sitting.  Sometimes real teaching requires real world experience. Oh and have them set it to auto pay for peace of mind!

I never got a credit card approved until I was 25.  I've never maxed out a card, I only have 3 and have a huge credit limit with low utilization.  There was times when I really enjoyed my credit of course and have luxury but I've also learned how to use them better, balance transfer and utilize 0% offers.  All would have been easily taught to me by a parent as I would've chosen better cards or had good habits sooner - it's not rocket science!

I still never purged on credit and I have a poor score because of it.  Having a child was a real eye opener and I took on more financial responsibility for myself as well as for my child.  For the first time ever I got a car on finance so it was more modern and safe and not a junker. (I still have my old car because I loved it so much and it wasn't worth anything - it was registered in 1990 - yes you heard it's 30 years old but hasn't seen the road for many years!)  My partner and I now save and made a pact that we have not to use credit, only the saving to cover our requirements so we never pay interests or get buried in monthly payments.  This was our best financial decision to date.  

It's been two and a half years and we're sitting on low thousands which will now be used for putting towards a deposit for a bigger house.  For our child as soon as we had the certificate we opened a child saver.  The interest is 3%.  We put in all the baby gift money and I set up a standing order for 2.50 per week to the saver.  I did this so it was guaranteed to grow.  If no other funds are added when 18 is reached the balance will be 2,658.  That's the minimum without additional gifting and savings and interest.  Just to be safe we are keeping this account under our hats so we don't end up finding it wasted or put towards the partners fancy car! I would really like it to go towards a mortgage.

I was loved as a kid which is super important! But I wasn't a kid forever.  My financial advice was in the most literal sense good as I didn't have debt but this was under the premise that I would have financial success and be a great saver.....I wasn't and I couldn't because I wasn't taught it!

We do have debt but we have a good debt plan so in a few years we can go house hunting.

My misc advice is this.  One day your financially dependent bubble of joy will grow up to be a financially independent mess if you don't include them in the reality of credit and debt.  Don't just say debt is bad, it's bad because........but you also may need it to.......buy a house, stay safe online, buy a good used car.  You may even consider the trick of loaning your child the money to make larger purchases and garnishing the pocket money until it's paid back.  They'll remember when they're older how gutting it is to pay for luxury items on tick as it reduces disposable income which could not only encourage them to save for the item but would also stop impulse buying items when they have time to realize while saving they didn't really need a new tv and the tv they have is just fine!

Also consider positive in selling old items off to build money for new ones.  Car boot sales or via a channel where there a little fees or issues. It's fun to sell and exciting to have the pennies then you encourage a percentage to savings and the rest to buy new toys or luxuries.

If you would even find this a struggle involve your child in YOUR basic finances but with a positive outlook.  When shopping tell them the budget and get them to help finding deals and discounts.  If they can reduce your shopping bill of essentials the rest can be a luxury like a cake mix to bake later on or a favorite desert.  Learning to shop for the best deal is also important.

Remember your Mum is your Mum, not an accountant or qualified financial advisor.  This means even advice that is simply good may not be factually practical!  In fact looking back most advice was in it&amp;#39;s simplest black and white form.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example I never got pocket money, I usually only saw money when there was an item I needed to buy of that amount.  What am I learning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financially I was learning nothing other than what was in my hand was for spending on what I what I wanted.  The reason for this was &amp;#39;not being able to afford&amp;#39; to give me pocket money.  Which all in is fine, as a parent now though if pocket money is not viable perhaps as a parent you could consider taking the cost of the item and increasing it by a percentage.  Even if it&amp;#39;s 3%.  Encourage the 3% to go in to a savings account or jar for your child and let them watch it grow.  I never had or was encouraged to save ever and it&amp;#39;s likely the reason I struggled to save as a young adult.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When at college I was encouraged to take out a student loan by a friend.  I refused as on the black and white principle of my financial upbringing was that LOANS ARE BAD.....CREDIT CARDS ARE BAD.  Again, perfectly true statements.  I continued to refuse loans and credit in to my adult life as it was BAD.  However, here another problem lies.  I&amp;#39;m still living in poverty and starting to work which is great but I can&amp;#39;t get ANYTHING because I don&amp;#39;t have debt - I can afford money for improving my lifestyle but I have no credit history therefore I cannot get finance contract for a phone.  I&amp;#39;m stuck with costly Pay As You Go.  The internet and it&amp;#39;s benefits are really taking off (yes I&amp;#39;m old ok) but credit cards offer online purchase security, but I can&amp;#39;t get a credit card so I&amp;#39;m vulnerable if use my debit.  In this scenario encouraging only one credit card to your young adult for online use and start building credit history.  If they mess it up they will learn and because you&amp;#39;ve taught them how to save for 18 years they have bail out sitting.  Sometimes real teaching requires real world experience. Oh and have them set it to auto pay for peace of mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never got a credit card approved until I was 25.  I&amp;#39;ve never maxed out a card, I only have 3 and have a huge credit limit with low utilization.  There was times when I really enjoyed my credit of course and have luxury but I&amp;#39;ve also learned how to use them better, balance transfer and utilize 0% offers.  All would have been easily taught to me by a parent as I would&amp;#39;ve chosen better cards or had good habits sooner - it&amp;#39;s not rocket science!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still never purged on credit and I have a poor score because of it.  Having a child was a real eye opener and I took on more financial responsibility for myself as well as for my child.  For the first time ever I got a car on finance so it was more modern and safe and not a junker. (I still have my old car because I loved it so much and it wasn&amp;#39;t worth anything - it was registered in 1990 - yes you heard it&amp;#39;s 30 years old but hasn&amp;#39;t seen the road for many years!)  My partner and I now save and made a pact that we have not to use credit, only the saving to cover our requirements so we never pay interests or get buried in monthly payments.  This was our best financial decision to date.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been two and a half years and we&amp;#39;re sitting on low thousands which will now be used for putting towards a deposit for a bigger house.  For our child as soon as we had the certificate we opened a child saver.  The interest is 3%.  We put in all the baby gift money and I set up a standing order for 2.50 per week to the saver.  I did this so it was guaranteed to grow.  If no other funds are added when 18 is reached the balance will be 2,658.  That&amp;#39;s the minimum without additional gifting and savings and interest.  Just to be safe we are keeping this account under our hats so we don&amp;#39;t end up finding it wasted or put towards the partners fancy car! I would really like it to go towards a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was loved as a kid which is super important! But I wasn&amp;#39;t a kid forever.  My financial advice was in the most literal sense good as I didn&amp;#39;t have debt but this was under the premise that I would have financial success and be a great saver.....I wasn&amp;#39;t and I couldn&amp;#39;t because I wasn&amp;#39;t taught it!&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"I’m fortunate to have a bit of cash on hand and be receiving unemployment, but I also have significant debts and the future of my job is very uncertain at the moment. Basically seeking out advice on best practices for managing a hefty debt in my current situation. 

In more detail:

-	I’m a freelance filmmaker. No current jobs, and a great deal of uncertainty on when those jobs will return (word around the industry is late August for productions to get going again) 
-	I currently have about $3k in the bank, and only have that much thanks to finally getting paid from my last job before the shutdown.
-	I do have a side job that I was laid off from due to COVID, so thankfully I’ve been able to collect $600/week of unemployment from that since it doesn’t seem to have kicked in for independent contractors yet. 

Mortgage/car payments/utilities make up roughly $1,300 or so. I’ve been able to suspend student loan payments thankfully. 

Other debts:

-	Credit card 1: roughly $8,000 (low APR) 
-	Credit card 2: less than $50 (high APR)
-	Credit card 3: $200 (0% APR currently)
-	Credit card 4: $100 (low APR)
-	Credit card 5: About $500 (higher APR) 
-	Will owe a good chunk in taxes as well once I file (I pay in as an independent contractor) 

Idea 1: basically use the government’s own money to pay for a portion of the taxes I owe them. 

Idea 2: pay down all my lower-balance credit cards and throw the rest at the highest balance card. 

Idea 3: stow it away in savings given the uncertainty on when my jobs will show up again and use unemployment to pay down the credit cards in the meantime. 

Basically, I’ve convinced myself that any of these options are probably wise, but not sure which approach would be most practical right now for me, or if there’s a more optimal way of using the extra cash that I’m not seeing.

,povertyfinance,"I'm 26f, live alone in a $840 studio apartment with my two cats. I don't know how to drive or own a car (can't afford it anyhow so it wouldn't matter if I did have a license). I work 37hr a week doing data entry and phone reception for a small retail store. I have been working here since 2017 and while it was very exciting and fun at first, slowly it has started to really wear on me. Mostly because I don't make enough to sustain myself. 


I use Uber to get to work. When I moved into my apartment my sister and I had a plan that she was going to take me to work and bring me back but her chronic illness has gotten worse and now I use Uber a lot more. I have calculated how much I spend on Uber per month and it comes out to be around $240ish a month. Sometimes more. I try to tip big because I know the drivers are probably struggling with money too. 


I didn't have a very functional upbringing and didn't have most of the opportunities to progress in life as most people do. I was homeschooled which later turned into unschooling *no school at all* and my dad was never home and my mom was sick so I never had anyone to teach me how to drive. We did Sears driving lessons twice but it wasn't enough for me to get comfortable driving on the road and we couldn't afford more lessons and there was no one I knew who could let me practice in their car. I ended up giving up eventually. My permit is expired.


The greatest accomplishment I have done for myself was getting my GED in 2016. After that I started doing simple data entry volunteer work via VolunteerMatch for non-profit companies and with that experience under my belt I was hired for the job I have right now. 


The thing is, I am getting tired and burnt out of struggling and living paycheck to paycheck unable to save up for anything that could help me progress in life like driving lessons or a car. It feels like I am spinning wheels just living in limbo, forever stuck barely getting the things I need. I have used newspaper as toilet paper for a few months because I couldn't afford it. I do have food stamps but it's only $16 a month which isn't a whole lot. Cat litter and food and soap and stuff like that comes out of my grocery budget so it really hurts sometimes. I have skipped groceries some weeks because I couldn't afford it after I got bills taken care of. 


I struggle a lot to buy groceries and pet food and have to ask my sister for help sometimes. I rarely ask my dad for help because I want to be independent but he sends me money sometimes like $20-$50 once every few months or so. It all helps. I feel like my current lifestyle is not sustainable


My monthly earnings are $1,344 after taxes. Water is included with my rent.


Rent: $840 (includes pet fees, water, pest control, garbage etc.)


Electricity: Usually $120


Internet and phone: $98


Renter's insurance: $12


Health insurance (marketplace): $38 (I sometimes don't pay because I can't afford it)


Uber: $240


Groceries: $20ish


(Note: I know the internet is not a true necessity but I use it to be qualified for work at home jobs openings because they won't hire you if you don't have wired internet)


My situation is starting to make me feel kind of depressed. My job stresses me out and I don't feel like I do a good job which makes my self-esteem feel like crap. I have POTS and can't stand for long periods of time (I get extremely faint and sick) which makes getting a second side gig doing fast food not an option. I don't have any education so most office jobs (other than the one I have now) are out. I want to work from home because I feel like I have a good chance making it happen. I just need to find a company to hire me.

 I can't save for anything or put money back. I have no emergency fund. 97% of my paycheck goes instantly to rent and bills and then whatever is left over is for Uber rides only. Grocery money is different every week.

,povertyfinance,"Hi all, I’m on mobile so apologies for formatting. 

I (20) currently live with my parents. However, my parents have been kinda hinting that they want me out of the house and honestly, I’ve been wanting to move out for quite some time now. Some background, I’m a sophomore at a university in California. My dilemma is this: I get free tuition because my dad is a disabled veteran, but in order to receive that tuition money I need to make a yearly income below that of the poverty level (roughly $13k/year). So, in order to qualify for free tuition for the 2020-2021 school year, i need to make &lt;$13k during 2019, and so on for each subsequent year.

If it’s possible, how would I go about living on that budget?

,povertyfinance,"First, let me say that it's great that everyone is here.  There's immense value in belonging to a financial community that's focused on the issues you're dealing with, and all the success stories I've seen here is testament to that.  That being said, I'm ashamed of myself every time I come here, and I'll tell you why in a minute...    

A little background...I started out in a lower-middle class household, but for the most part, one without financial pressures.  My parents divorced when I was 4, after which point my mom raised the kids via odd jobs, child support, and government aid.  I obviously had no concept of finances at the time, but things were noticeably tight.  Around the age of 9, I remember going to a classmates house for a sleepover (upper-middle class), and it was just a whole different world to me, in a depressing way.  They had cable TV, they had money for the ice cream truck that came through the neighborhood, he even had video games in his bedroom.  I don't mean to suggest those expenses are the sign of success, but they highlighted the class difference to me at the time.  In high school, for reasons that were solely my own, I made poor use of my time, resulting in average grades, not preparing for life after high school, and failing to recognize that a career wouldn't just fall into my lap.  For 5 years afterwards, I floundered in minimum wage fast food and retail jobs.  Despite the poor income (less than 1K a month), I was able to get by living with roommates, having an old car, always paying off my credit card balance in full, and not having a family to support.  I was surviving, and not falling behind in a numerical sense, and because of that, I remained in that situation much longer than I should have.  Despite having no debt, I did spend almost all my disposable income on the couple hobbies I had, so at the age of 24, I had maybe 1-2K in the bank, and a net worth not much higher.  I actually don't recall the exact catalyst that lead to looking for a better lot in life, but I got my foot in the door with a staffing agency, who hired me for a few one-off assignments, which led to a regular part time job.  On an hourly basis, the part time job was paying 2-3x as much as my previous jobs, but more than the money, the work was just so much more interesting, my co-workers were a more ambitious group of people than I was used to working with, and when I felt a conversation veering into the territory of ""so what do you do for a living?"", I wasn't embarrassed.  More so than any prior time in my life, I really applied myself in that role, and it lead to a full time job, which became a career.  I've been out of the ""struggle economy"" for almost a decade now, still have no debt, and a bank/brokerage account north of 200K.  Although it's funny, I still feel like it could all fall apart rather quickly, so maybe that part of the brain never turns off...perhaps a blessing and a curse.  

Anyways, back to the point...for all the good things I see here, inevitably, there's some point at which I find myself angry when reading someones predicament.  I realize this is just me projecting anger at my younger self, and my parents, but it's such a strong emotional response that it bothers me.  I actually think this is a field where I could help people.  It's too bad children aren't given good financial advice in high school (home economics, if that even exists anymore, doesn't cut it), although I do worry about a government institution giving children financial advice, when government finances are a complete disaster.  A website or book doesn't interest me, as I'm not much of a writer, and those are one-way and impersonal.  Individual counseling could be a good testing ground, and to that end, I'm interested in seeing what adaptations would need to be made to the financial tools I use (mainly Google Sheets) to track and visualize finances, to apply to a wider range of situations.

,povertyfinance,"Hey all! I’m at a total loss on what to do right now. 

Some background: Due to obvious circumstances, I got furloughed from my retail management job back in March. I filed all of my unemployment paperwork (USA), and because the CARES Act included the supplemental $600, I’m receiving double the amount I usually earn from actually working. I also received the $1,200 stimulus payment, and about $1,000 from some personal life nonsense. 

I currently hold about $3,000 in credit card debt (down from $3,800 in March, $4,000 limit). I have $2,000 in my savings, and $4,000 in my checking. Y’all, this is the most money I’ve had since living with my folks while working full time. But back then, I had the absolute worst spending habits. I just don’t know what to do with this “extra” money right now. 

Should I just go ahead and pay off the $3,000 credit card debt to save the ~$150 I pay a month in payments and fees, and to increase my credit score? Or should I continue to build up my six month emergency fund? 

My biggest concern with just paying off the credit card is that I don’t know if I will return back to my current job. If I get laid off because of this wild time, I don’t know how the job market will be and I’m concerned I won’t be able to find work. The supplemental $600 for unemployment ends July. I may find myself in a really tight spot financially in a couple months, so the idea of having a few grand in savings is appealing. 

Y’all are amazing with the advice you give. Please help! 😅

Edit: 

You guys are so freaking amazing with all the advice and support! 

It seems that paying off the card is the majority of the advice being given. After stewing on it for a bit (shoutout to self-reflection during quarantine), it also seems that the uncertainty of my employment is my biggest stress. But damn that extra $150/mo I’m losing in fees. 

So, I think I’ve decided on a decent middle ground. My first priority will be getting my savings up to a three month emergency fund (instead of six), just because of the uncertainty of the job market in the future. After that’s all said and done, I’ll be using the remainder of my “additional income” to pay off as much of my credit debt as I can. If I’ve done my math correctly, and I keep my spending in check (which is so incredibly easy these days), I should have my savings where I want it by mid-June at the latest. Which means I should also be able to cut my debt down to $1,000-$1,500 (dependent on how aggressive I am in payments over the next 6 weeks) by the first week of July. I’m hoping to get it down to $1,100 to finally be below 30% utilization again. 

It’s not the most ideal plan for my savings or credit debt since I’m not at the six month emergency fund mark OR debt-free, but I do feel like it’s the safest plan for me in a worst-case scenario.

,povertyfinance," 

Hi everyone,

I was young and financially inept at some point in my life, which resulted in a phone bill of over £1000. The discussion around my responsibility can probably be a different topic elsewhere, however, the phone provider themselves never took action to stop charging my account for over two years. The date of default was September 2014, but they continued charging up to March 2017 (hence the amount).

I finally took steps to own up to this mistake of mine and rang the provider today, asking to discuss this bill and set up some payment plan. However, they said the only thing I could do is to either pay up the balance or set up a direct debit. I raised the issue of the debt going into Defaulted in 2014 but they kept charging this account until 2017 and I'd like to at least discuss what I should actually be paying or have them explain this to me in writing rather than just pay up straight away.

They said that the account is so old and they can't do anything about this, so their advice now is to ring back to find out whether they have sold the debt on to a DCA or cancel the debt. I asked them to update my address so that I would be kept in the loop if the DCA tries to contact me (or worse, if they issue a CCJ to my old address). They said that they cannot do this as the account has been closed for more than two years.

I feel like I'm being trapped or falling into some sort of a trap here. How would I know if they issue a CCJ to my old address in the next couple of week and I had no chance of respond? I asked if they could write to me all this in an email or letter and they refused to. Is there anything I can do? I'm trying now to correct my credit but felt being turned away. Is there anything I could do here?

&lt;p&gt;I was young and financially inept at some point in my life, which resulted in a phone bill of over £1000. The discussion around my responsibility can probably be a different topic elsewhere, however, the phone provider themselves never took action to stop charging my account for over two years. The date of default was September 2014, but they continued charging up to March 2017 (hence the amount).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally took steps to own up to this mistake of mine and rang the provider today, asking to discuss this bill and set up some payment plan. However, they said the only thing I could do is to either pay up the balance or set up a direct debit. I raised the issue of the debt going into Defaulted in 2014 but they kept charging this account until 2017 and I&amp;#39;d like to at least discuss what I should actually be paying or have them explain this to me in writing rather than just pay up straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said that the account is so old and they can&amp;#39;t do anything about this, so their advice now is to ring back to find out whether they have sold the debt on to a DCA or cancel the debt. I asked them to update my address so that I would be kept in the loop if the DCA tries to contact me (or worse, if they issue a CCJ to my old address). They said that they cannot do this as the account has been closed for more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"I just needed to share this somewhere. I have (or had!!) a collections account for $2000. Basically what happened was, about three/four years ago my very abusive ex went to jail and I was able to escape the apartment I was in. It was a month to month lease so I went to the property management, explained the entire situation, explained that in his fits of rage he had absolutely destroyed the unit by ripping off doors/punching holes in the way. They said as long as I left the unit within a few days and was agreeing to forfeit my deposit, they wouldn’t hold me liable for the damages. 

Out of sight out of mind. Except a year later I got a phone call from a collections company stating they sent me to collections. I don’t know why they went after me other than money is money and I’m likely easier to find considering the ex is in and out of jail and doesn’t work whereas I’ve been in the same general area for years and worked the entire time. It was for $2000. I got freaked out when they called and hung up to avoid admitting the debt was mine. 

The only thing holding back my credit score was this fucking collections account. I make every single payment on time, keep my utilization low, and pay the full balance on time every month. But having a huge collections account is obviously horrible for your score. Two of the credit bureaus didn’t recognize that I had an account in collections but my experian score still did. 

I disputed it once before and was denied. I didn’t want to start making payments on it but I didn’t want it to just sit there. I didn’t really have enough money sitting around in full until very recently but I was still hesitant even paying it. A month ago, I tried disputing it again.

I have (or had!!) a collections account for $2000. Basically what happened was, about three/four years ago my very abusive ex went to jail and I was able to escape the apartment I was in. It was a month to month lease so I went to the property management, explained the entire situation, explained that in his fits of rage he had absolutely destroyed the unit by ripping off doors/punching holes in the way. They said as long as I left the unit within a few days and was agreeing to forfeit my deposit, they wouldn’t hold me liable for the damages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of sight out of mind. Except a year later I got a phone call from a collections company stating they sent me to collections. I don’t know why they went after me other than money is money and I’m likely easier to find considering the ex is in and out of jail and doesn’t work whereas I’ve been in the same general area for years and worked the entire time. It was for $2000. I got freaked out when they called and hung up to avoid admitting the debt was mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing holding back my credit score was this fucking collections account. I make every single payment on time, keep my utilization low, and pay the full balance on time every month. But having a huge collections account is obviously horrible for your score. Two of the credit bureaus didn’t recognize that I had an account in collections but my experian score still did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disputed it once before and was denied. I didn’t want to start making payments on it but I didn’t want it to just sit there. I didn’t really have enough money sitting around in full until very recently but I was still hesitant even paying it. A month ago, I tried disputing it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an email from experian this morning. Deleted from my report. The dispute fucking worked!!! My score went up this morning!! &lt;/p&gt;

I haven’t received a stimulus payment yet. According to the IRS website, I shouldn’t use the “Non-Filers” tool as I have to file taxes for 2019. I know I should have, but in 2019 ... I never filed my 2018 tax return. So the IRS doesn’t have any direct deposit info/an address to mail a check.

I’m trying to use TurboTax for my 2019 taxes, but I’m missing some information. I have been homeless and without a mailing address since last fall so I never received two W2’s and my tax info from PA’s unemployment benefit in the mail.

For the first job, I have no paystubs or anything in addition to no W2. I only worked there for 2-3 weeks in 2019, so I think I could estimate the amount I made fairly accurately, though I forget exactly how much I made hourly...

For the second job, I have no W2 but I do have my paystub from my last paycheck from 2019. I was wondering if I may be able to use this somehow/can I file my taxes with it?

I never received the tax info from PA’s unemployment office either and I am pretty sure I did not have taxes taken out of the benefits. I think it’s called form 1099-G? PA’s unemployment website has a link to view your tax info form, but when I click on it is says that currently only the initial application for benefits is online. I haven’t figured out a way to view any documents from the unemployment office, but I did calculate the total amount I received.

,povertyfinance,"So let me break it down for y'all:

*Started going to community college in 2014. Considered a dependent at the time and my dad made too much money for me to qualify for any grants and I wasn't sure if I qualified for scholarships. As of today, I owe nearly $10,000 in student loans.

*2015 rolls in and I desperately need my wisdom teeth pulled. I needed to be put under in order to get through the procedure without complications, so insurance could only cover so much. Signed up for a $1,500 CareCredit card to pay for a $980 procedure.

*Later in 2015, my dog also needs oral surgery. Total cost: $2,000. I stupidly extend my limit on the CareCredit card to $2,400.

*2016, radiator on my old car is overheating. Stupidly signed up for a CitiBank credit card through Merchant's (Now NTB tire) with a $1,200 limit to fix it.

*2017, went from two jobs to one bc the restaurant mgr didn't know his head from a hole in the ground. Income went from $18-$20,000 a year to now $14-$16,000 a year. I also sank $1,500 into a Volvo with more mechanical problems than you can throw a wrench at. Literally drove it into the ground until last year when it died on me.

*2015-2017, get into several accidents that were my fault and I end up paying for all the repair costs. I eat a nearly $200 insurance bill every month up until this past February when my dad got me a new car and got insurance taken care of.

*Later in 2017, I once again made the huge mistake of signing up for a small credit card from my bank. $500 limit that I couldn't pay back due to my severe impulse spending. 

*2018, got a $2,000 credit union loan to consolidate my debt. Huge mistake as I was already having trouble making any kind of payments on my one income.

*2018-2019, I rely on the Earnin app to supplement my income. Can't get a better paying job to do that and I'm still trying to figure out why that is. Paychecks get eaten like cookies with the Cookie Monster. I once again fall behind on my payments.

*I also get hit with a $190 Verizon bill from when I broke things off with my abusive ex. It gets sent to collections and I still haven't given them any money.

*Late 2019, I get desperate and get two payday loans totalling up to $1,780. Again, I fall behind on all my payments and my impulse spending gets infinitely worse to the point of hoarding useless crap.

Now here I am in 2020, still trying to find a better full time job, but the pandemic threw a monkey wrench into that plan. I'm desperately looking for part time work to cover my reduced hours. I was hoping that UI and the CARES Act would come through for me, but I earn too much each week to qualify despite the reduced hours. I'm now in a place where I have to depend on my dad for basic necessities and I feel like a complete leech and lowlife for allowing myself to make these horrendous decisions, even when my dad signed off on some of these debts.

Most of my debt is now in collections and my credit score is a joke.

I also tried to start a $25 a month savings plan, but that was before the pandemic hit of course. Now I'm trying to get those payments to stop until I can figure out how to get back on track with everything.

Where do I even begin with tackling this much debt with a reduced income? These companies I owe money to don't seem to want to help me now bc I didn't reach out to them sooner. I don't even know how to budget for anything.

A couple of months ago, my doc sent me to the hospital for a galactogram, but they weren't able to do the test. The specialist messed around with my breast for a bit, but they didn't inject me with the dye or do the mammogram or anything.

Today, I got a bill for over $1000 (that's after insurance). I called billing to ask about it, and they're looking into it. But the nurse says the bill might not change much because the doc did look at me and they opened up the dyes and needles (even though they didn't use them).

I'm still waiting to hear back from radiology coding, but  I'm really overwhelmed. I've never really disputed my medical bills before. Should I be calling my insurance company too? Is there anything else I can do?

,povertyfinance,"I originally posted this in r/personalfinance and basically got told that I can never afford a house ever. So, reposting here because maybe this subreddit is more down to earth. 

Hi guys, my wife and I recently graduated college and have been thinking about buying a house. We currently live in a manufactured home that we pay 450 a month in rent. I have read loads of contradictory things online and wanted to get some real life thoughts from you all. We live in Alabama where the cost of living is low but so are the salaries so just keep that in mind when I lay out the finances.

We make around 70k a year combined and we net around 4,300 a month. We also have around 10k in savings. We currently have around 800 dollars a month we pay towards just debt(student and car loans). My wife's car will be paid off within this year, however. We have no kids and never plan on having any.

How much house do you realistically think we can afford? I've plugged our numbers into almost every online calculator and they range between 150k-250k and that to me seems high to me. I know that at the lower end that would be about 1k a month on a house payment which is only a quarter of our monthly income.

Am I just being paranoid or do real life people really spend 30-50% of their income on just housing?

Thanks!

From March until April 27th, I have received my unemployment + the 600 in government bonus.

I should have received the next installment by now (Friday, May 8th), but my bank account is showing a whopping 37 cents.

It's the start of May, I have bills to pay, food to buy, gas to fill, and extras like termite treatment, and my first speeding ticket in my life.

I have 37 cents in my account.

**I have received no update as to why the money has not been deposited yet.** My employer has not contacted me saying work has started again (and we're a small, close retail company where everyone talks on group text - she would have absolutely told me!).

I don't know what is going on. Calling is absolutely USELESS - the phone is always busy and I have waited for HOURS. I don't know who to email or contact about this, as I have never been in this position before.

What could have gone wrong??

Is it because so many people have filed? Is it because it is a new month? Every single week I've been receiving money consistently, so this is something new. **This is the first time it has been late.**

,povertyfinance,"Good afternoon everybody!

I've started budgeting and taking my finances seriously over the past month or two. As a result, I've cut down my spending and everything, which is fantastic! I've never truly taken my finances seriously, but with the current situation, I've taken a realistic view of my finances at 24 years old. (Yes, I know. I made dumb decisions when I was younger, but I'm working on it.)

Here are my current income streams:

1) VA Disability (\~1113/month)  
2) Vocational Rehab BAH payments (\~1380/month)  
3) Part time job making 15/hr w/ around 20-25 hrs/week. (\~1200/month)

Here's my debt (ouch):

1) CC #1 $3088 balance  
2) CC #2 $2077 balance  
3) Truck loan \~$7200 balance   
4) Motorcycle \~$3100 balance  
5) Back taxes from IRS (\~$180)  


In regards to the CC debt, I applied for a balance transfer CC yesterday and got approved with a 0% apr for 21 months and a 7800 limit. I've transferred both CC balances to this card. When it's all said and done, the balance is somewhere around \~5600, which I plan to pay in full before the 21 months are over. I've been thinking of contributing a percentage of my part time job money into it, but entirely unsure of how much I should contribute. In the meantime, I've kept my CCs at home and not in my wallet.

In regards to the back taxes I owe, I've been having a hard time getting ahold of the IRS and they won't mail me a password so I can check/pay my balance. I attempted to go through another vendor, but they can't verify my debt. I'm not really sure on what I can even do here.

My truck/motorcycle payments aren't that bad and I'm not underwater on either of these loans. 

Here are some of the monthly expenses I currently have:

1) Rent w/ water \~$1030  
2) Utilities \~$200 (Most likely will go up due to living in the south)  
3) CC Payments after balance transfer (\~250-300)  
4) Truck and motorcycle payment (\~620 including insurance)  
5) Retirement fund (\~5% of part time check to equal employer's match)

Since I'm graduating within the next year (scheduled to be in May 2021), I'm planning to move across the country. Most likely somewhere out west. I'm trying to set myself up for the best for when I do graduate and move.

Let's get this out of the way: I was raised in a cult. This means a lot of ""Yeah, duh, this is obvious"" situations are not obvious to me. I was not taught a lot of basic human things. I've been out a few years but I'm only just now realizing how co-dependent I was and how effed up my childhood was. I was taught that to praise God, I had to stay home forever and do nothing. This will explain the odd circumstances for my age in the following paragraphs.......

I'm in my mid twenties and I'm having trouble consistently keeping a job, though I can't get past minimum-wage part-time jobs. I never learned how to drive, which of course greatly impacts where and when I can work. I'm in college and the first few semesters I paid with a credit card because I didn't know FAFSA was a thing. I am living off savings of a few random jobs I've had but it's quickly dwindling. I am really broke and I don't know what to do, especially during COVID when practically no one is hiring (not that I'd be able to get to those places anyways). \[And I'll add someone suggested I look into jobs at my school which was a great idea but then COVID happened and now they're not hiring.\]

My computer is on its last legs. I have 1 pair of pants. I can't drive (and needless to say don't have a car) and therefore it's incredibly difficult for me to find work.

I'm sad, I'm sick, I'm miserable. 

I am suppose to get married to my partner in the next coming years, but they are actively against me taking on loans in case they want to buy a house.

\-We would like to start investing and put money away for retirement (husband is now union and has generous pension and 401k, I'm currently a waitress but I am halfway through my accounting degree and retirement is an afterthought until I get my ""big kid job"", but it is a consideration.

\-We would like to be homeowners in the next 5 years

Our debt: $5k balance on our highest credit card, $5k husband's student loans, $1800 medical debt in collections, $10k in student loans for me (will be around $25k when I graduate, not collecting interest right now, high incentive to start paying on it now)

I'm set to receive $600 + $60 a week up until the end of July, which is basically how much I made beforehand and I need literally every penny of it.  Today, I checked my bank account and I saw that I've been continuing to get paid biweekly: every two weeks, I'm being paid by the school systems, and I didn't even realize.  I have no idea what this is for, whether it's some independent relief the school system is doing for substitute teachers.  It's not much at all; I receive around 80 dollars every two weeks, though the exact amount changes.  I'm not sure what this is related to and how they're calculating this amount.

I didn't even realize I was getting this, but I haven't been filing it the past 4 weeks I've filed for unemployment.  I'm scared that I screwed up and they're going to stop paying me the $660 a week or ask for it back, because I made this small income every two weeks without realizing.  Is there any way to ""retroactively"" file this income I've made? I guess it's around 160-200 I've made from the school system the past five-ish weeks (nobody from the school system picks up my calls either).

Also, when I report the income starting now, is it going to be deducted from my weekly unemployment? I make $660 a week from unemployment, and it seems the schools give me around 40 dollars a week.

,povertyfinance,"Hi all! I've stalked this sub for awhile and I have good news I wanted to share with y'all!
Starting from the top, I lost my decently well paying retail job last May. I've never been ""comfortable"" with my wages at any point in my life yet, but for the area and my rent it was good.

From there I had some ups and downs and went through 3 jobs and was unable to get approved for unemployment because I quit one of them that was with a shady company. I am a freelance artist so thankfully I was able to keep my head above water for rent and bills but not much else.


I was running on fumes until January when I got a great admin job at a wonderful company. I adore it! But then in March I got into a car accident which totaled my poor Civic. 

Insurance covered my car in full - down $145 a month and insurance only went up $50 per month - and with some help from family I managed to buy a used car outright. Bam, $4500 debt, gone. I just owe $800 to my mom whenever.

And TODAY I finally paid off my PPal Credit account of $500! The stimulus check was the reason for this, plus the fact I am working from home. So that entire debt is also gone!

Now all that's left is my credit card, which is almost $4k, but I'll make a dent in it next paycheck. My biggest concern is interest and I got the advice to pay off the smallest debt first here.

After growing up lower middle class, suffering through 7.25 an hour back home, and losing my job and feeling unstable for almost a year, I have finally regained footing and it feels like a massive weight off my chest.

,povertyfinance," I had an emergency surgery (my appendix burst) about eight months ago while in an unstable living situation, and because the operation didn't take place in my home state and I didn't have a permanent address at the time, they didn't take my medicaid. The surgery cost around $11k, which I didn't have because I was unemployed. I made small payments on the total but couldn't afford the minimum payments set up by the hospital and the entire bill was sent to collections.

I just found out I have around $17k in a 529 account my grandparents left for me, and I'd like to cash it out and pay off my bill.

I know I'm on the hook for it and I'd like to take responsibility.

How do I find out what collections company bought my bill? I haven't received any mail, emails, or phone calls from any company, including the hospital, tbh I didn't even realize it was sent to collections until I logged into the MyHealth account to make a payment.

,povertyfinance,"I added a flair of ""wellness"" because I don't know what else to flair it.

I was trying to think of what to make myself to eat for today when I thought, ""tomato soup sounds good"". But I don't jave tomato soup. I do have tomato paste though!

So I added to the pot

* 1 can tomato paste (6 ounces) which was 25c 
* 4 cans water (so 24 oz) = free!
* 2 tsp salt (I added .01 to the price for this but the big salt container is .55 so it's cheaper) although I am going to half that next time.
* 1/8 tsp pepper (added .01 for this)
* 1/4 cup rice (.08 if buying a 5 pound bag at $3)
* 2 tsp sugar (I guessed .05 because I buy 4 pounds for $1.89)
* Green onion I picked from my yard but usually costs .50 for a bunch. I only used one though so I counted .10 just to be safe.

I brought it a boil then simmered it for 20 minutes. It's pretty good, filling, and cheaper than I realized when I started cooking it. It does need less alt though lol

I may make this more often. Even if I am buying a more expensive tomato paste at .42 (from Wal-mart) or .75 (from Dollar General) that's still a really cheap meal.

Because my clients couldn't work or travel after March 20, they all cancelled their reservations. My income dried up overnight. 

I couldn't afford my house anymore and moved in with a relative to share a small apartment. 

I applied for the EIDL and didn't get it. 

I applied for the PPP and didn't get it. 

I applied for UI and PUA and didn't get it. 

I did not receive a stimulus check. 

The only assistance I was able to obtain is food stamps. Thank God I can eat now. I'm not eligible for any other state assistance programs.

I was driving for Uber Eats but my tires are shot now. 

What do I do? My income is zero. Here are my bills: 

--Health insurance $270/mo. 

--IRS Installment $250/mo. I called in March and they said they would reduce it to $50 for two months. But they are still charging me the $250. 

--Car insurance $80/mo (mandatory in my state) 

--Cell phone $90/mo (my only internet rn)

--Business bills $100/mo (payroll software, client management software). 

--Miscellaneous expenses $100/mo (for prescriptions, cat food, non-EBT necessities).

We are not rich, but we live comfortably thanks to my parents’ years of hard work when we were younger. 

The job market is extremely sparse and finding a position, especially for new grads is tough. I’m trying to think ahead and decide what to do or what options my family has. If both of my parents lose their jobs, we will definitely lose our house, and given the timeline of their potential lay-offs, they would not be eligible to collect the extra $600 per week in unemployment, and their unemployment would not cover our monthly mortgage. 

I have been laid off since March due to COVID, and I have been collecting up the extra UI and saving. I have enough to pay our home mortgage for about 2 months, and collectively my parents have enough to pay for about another 4 months. I am also actively applying to positions, but no luck yet. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation or if there is anything we can do job wise or money wise to get through this. My state is still on lockdown, but I don’t think too many jobs will be open once it does open back up.

I am 25 yrs old- the point of this post is to see if you think I have a good chance of being accepted for an apartment application. I live in Madison, WI (housing is expensive) and at 21 years old -I was really dumb and took out a few credit cards/went on vacation. I was also making more money than I am now but I was miserable. Since then it's been a long challenge to pay off 800+ in parking tickets/tow fees, 3 or 4 credit cards, and my score jumped almost 100 points in a year. No derogatory remarks on my credit

&amp;#x200B;

Now all I have left to pay off is:

\-- $393 with elan financial services in collections  (paying it off fully in 2 weeks when I get paid again, as I put my stim check to it being 1500 ish before)

\-- 7k  car loan (never missed a payment, in good standing)

\-- 11k in student loans- (also in good standing)

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend makes about 50k a year- I make 34-37k (I do sales)

The apartment search for fall for a 1yr lease is so crazy right now- barely anyone seems to be moving- and lots of scammers out there trying to give sob stories to take advantage of people not seeing / doing showings due to Covid.

,povertyfinance,"TLDR:

I've tightened my pursestrings so much that I rarely spend money on anything other than essentials. How do I convince myself that it's ok to spend money on myself every once in a while, especially with more expensive purchases?

-------

I used to be a little more fast and loose with my money, but over the years I've cut out a lot of my frivolous spending and, after a few bouts of barely having money, I am a lot more strict with my spending. I have a budget (shoutout You Need A Budget) and no longer feel like I'm living paycheck to paycheck, despite not having a huge income. 

I'm  happy I've gotten to this point and don't have to deal with the stress of not being sure I'll be able to pay rent next month. But now I rarely spend money ""on myself"" and I'm left feeling like I'm working just to pay the bills and survive and... it's really bumming me out.

Part of it is being strict with my spending, but the other issue is that the money I want to spend isn't just pocket change. I'll occasionally buy a cheap doodad on sale, but the stuff I *feel* like I really want costs far more. 

If I spend $15 dollars on something and I end up not enjoying it as much as I had hoped, then, whoops, no big deal, but if I spend hundreds of dollars and it's a bust, then... it will be pretty upsetting.

I'm saving up for a few of these more expensive things, but I can't shake the feeling that they cost *too* much and I'm afraid might not be worth the money. It takes so much more time and discipline to save up for, so it feels like too much of a risk.

Common sense would tell you that since the landlord hired the realtor to find tenants, the landlord would pay the realtor fees.

&lt;p&gt;Common sense would tell you that since the landlord hired the realtor to find tenants, the landlord would pay the realtor fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In NY, those fees are paid by the tenant which is crazy to me. So on top of saving up for first, last, and a security deposit, I have to pay the realtors fees too? When I didn’t hire them? How does that make sense? The realtor fees aren’t even a percentage of the rent, IT’S A FULL MONTHS RENT! Don’t even get me started on landlords charging realtor fees even though you’re speaking and dealing with the landlord directly, it’s a straight up scam. How are people with low income supposed to move?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost impossible to save up to move when I need to have 4x the months rent to get in. &lt;/p&gt;

BF and I were promised that we would not be held liable for anything after we left. I should have gotten it in writing. I paid the remaining balance, and I called the complex once a month to make sure there was nothing else needed from me. *I called them until February, when I finally felt that everything was settled.* Uncle ended up signing a new lease with them after the 2.5 weeks.\n\nHe was evicted a month ago (Drinking and drug problems. We haven\'t spoken to him since December), and **suddenly I have received an email from the complex saying I owe them over $300 for rent from when they let Uncle stay there past our lease date.** They say if I don\'t pay it will go to collections.\n\nI called the complex and explained that they had made an arrangement with Uncle to live there longer, and he was the one they needed to contact.

I was the primary leaseholder, and the arrangement only lasted a year before BF and I moved out at the beginning of October. Uncle didn&amp;#39;t have a place to live when our lease ended, so he worked out an arrangement with the complex to allow him to stay for an additional 2.5 weeks. BF and I were promised that we would not be held liable for anything after we left. I should have gotten it in writing. I paid the remaining balance, and I called the complex once a month to make sure there was nothing else needed from me. &lt;em&gt;I called them until February, when I finally felt that everything was settled.&lt;/em&gt; Uncle ended up signing a new lease with them after the 2.5 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was evicted a month ago (Drinking and drug problems. We haven&amp;#39;t spoken to him since December), and &lt;strong&gt;suddenly I have received an email from the complex saying I owe them over $300 for rent from when they let Uncle stay there past our lease date.&lt;/strong&gt; They say if I don&amp;#39;t pay it will go to collections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called the complex and explained that they had made an arrangement with Uncle to live there longer, and he was the one they needed to contact. Also, &lt;strong&gt;why am I hearing about this now? 7 months later?&lt;/strong&gt;  Why was I being told I owed nothing for months? They had no answers.

,povertyfinance," I work in an insurance call center and wanted to take the time to share some important info, as these are problems that I frequently encounter. I know a lot of you here are wanting to switch, but this is important information to know when switching, or basic stuff to know now. Some of this might be ""duh"" type of stuff, but you'd be surprised how many people don't know this. 

1. It pays to know your deductible, literally. I have a lot of people call in who face sticker shock because they didn't know how high their deductible is. If you can afford to, put aside into savings how much you can afford to. Having a $1,000 deductible will save you a LOT of money over 10, 20 or how ever many years you will still be driving. Even saving $50 a month on your insurance is $18,000 over 30 years, enough to buy a cheap sedan! Plus your $1,000 in savings will earn a tid bit of interest. Your deductible is the amount YOU pay to the SHOP. It is not the amount they cover. In all honesty, a $0 deductible is a waste of money, especially if you are younger. 

2. Most insurance companies will let you get your cracked or chipped windshield replaced for no out of pocket costs. If you get a rock chip or an object hits your glass and a dollar bill will cover the area, call to get this fixed! Some people think it costs money to get this done, but the vast majority of insurance companies pay for the repairs with no cost to you. Letting it sit, especially in the sunlight will cause the chip to usually crack out further and then the whole windshield will need replaced, and of course you will have to pay your deductible! 

3. It pays to have full coverage. 20 years ago many people had liability on their ""beater cars"" but of course used cars could be had for $500. Today, an older and reliable vehicle is going to set you back at least $4,000. What makes more sense, paying $500-$1,000 for your deductible, or having to come up with $4,000 for a replacement car? Of course, this advice is not ""one size fits all"", but if there isn't a huge difference in cost between adding $500 to $1,000 deductible on comp and collision over liability, I would recommend getting full coverage! 

4. Fill in the gap. While most dealers may advertise gap coverage, not all do. It's a very good thing to have. This is usually a one-time fee added to the loan. If your car is worth $5,000 to the insurance company, but you still owe $9,000 on it, you will still be on the hook for $4,000, when the car is totaled out. 

5. Shop around, and shop often. Right now Progressive wants $980 a month for the same exact coverage I get with Country Financial for $275 a month. I have had a few accidents and this can REALLY make a difference in cost with some companies. Anytime you switch, ALWAYS make sure you have everything on the new quote. Rental car coverage, towing, etc will all cost more. Don't just assume because ABC insurance company was  the cheapest 15 years ago, that XYZ insurance company won't be half as much now.

,povertyfinance,"Hello all,

Hoping to get some advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation. 

I’m in Canada and I’m looking to move across country to be closer to my fiancé.  I’m just not sure what the best way of doing it is. 

I don’t have a post secondary degree so any job I find will be based on my experience and limited courses I’ve done. As such I don’t think I’ll find anyone willing to pay moving fees. 

A few questions I have:

1. Would you move first and then apply for jobs using savings to survive? Or do you find the job first and then try to find a place to live?

2. How do you word it on your resume that you’re willing to move. Would you change your location to the one you intend to live in or leave it as where you are? 

Any tips for moving, finding work or living spaces from a distance on a budget is greatly appreciated. 

I know I’ll need to save a lot to just make the move, I’m guessing somewhere in the ballpark of $5000. Does that sound somewhat reasonable assuming I’d be driving my own vehicle and first and last on an apartment is around $2200?

,povertyfinance,"Hi there - 24 y/o, child of immigrant parents, who never seemed to get out of the cycle of poverty.

My Dad is 63, a cab driver and my Mom is 58 and does not work. We lost our home in a foreclosure back in 2013, and my parents pretty much live paycheck to paycheck with no real savings or retirement. My Dad makes approximately 20k a year.

I graduated last year with my masters and $20k in student loans, and moved to the DC area for a job with the federal government. (My anxiety due to growing up with so little made me jump at the chance for some stability and great benefits lol)

However - parents don't want to move to the DMV area and want to stay in Florida. I send home about $500 each month to supplement.. but it's getting to be hard on me since I've made some poor financial choices myself. (i.e. CC debt) And I'm trying to be smart and strategic about this.

**TLDR;** Anyone have any tips on managing two households? I thought about maybe filing HoH on my taxes, and claiming my parents as dependents?

&lt;p&gt;My Dad is 63, a cab driver and my Mom is 58 and does not work. We lost our home in a foreclosure back in 2013, and my parents pretty much live paycheck to paycheck with no real savings or retirement. My Dad makes approximately 20k a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated last year with my masters and $20k in student loans, and moved to the DC area for a job with the federal government. (My anxiety due to growing up with so little made me jump at the chance for some stability and great benefits lol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However - parents don&amp;#39;t want to move to the DMV area and want to stay in Florida. I send home about $500 each month to supplement.. but it&amp;#39;s getting to be hard on me since I&amp;#39;ve made some poor financial choices myself. (i.e. CC debt) And I&amp;#39;m trying to be smart and strategic about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone have any tips on managing two households? I thought about maybe filing HoH on my taxes, and claiming my parents as dependents? I know there&amp;#39;s some income restrictions on that but looking to the future.. my Dad has Parkinson&amp;#39;s and will stop working and be making less. I also know there&amp;#39;s some tax breaks for Dependent care.. so any advice would help!&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Edit: Sorry the title is supposed to be '16 months', not 60 lol.

For background, I didn't begin earning above the poverty line until 2 years ago (and even then, only just barely). I didn't go to college, so I luckily have no student loan debt. I run my own freelancing business from home (graphic design) and have no other source of income, which means no solid consistency in what I earn. Some months I might earn $4k, other months I might earn $600. It's a fucking mess. It also means a big chunk of what I earn goes to taxes and operating costs. 

The truth is, I'd had my savings up to $1k, 3k, even 7k long before this. But it's always been drained. My car broke down. I had a heart problem, so I had to have a bunch of diagnostics done, and I'm self-employed, so I have no insurance. It's always something, you all know how this goes. It makes you feel like shit, knowing you spent 8 months to save up a piddly $2k and one little bullshit thing comes along and wipes it out instantly. 

On January of 2019, I had $82 in my ""Nest Egg"" savings account. [This is what it looks like today](https://imgur.com/2ECgFqr). Here's a breakdown of my financial strat:

---

Checking accounts:

- The Slush: This is money purely for blowing. Eating out, buying food, clothes, games, etc and so forth. I fully expect this to be emptied every month. This is also the last account to get funded. It's my lowest funding priority.

- Business Checking: This is my business money that's purely for blowing. I use this to buy resources like font licenses, stock photos, subscriptions, etc. It covers my material overhead. 

- Bills: I'm actually on *autopay* for most bills! This is fucking mindblowing to me. 3 years ago, the thought of autopay would have sent me into a tailspin of anxiety. But now, it all just comes from my ""Bills"" account, and every month, I make sure I have enough in it to cover the autopays. I feel so much better just dumping it in there and then never having to worry about whether I can buy or save this or that, or if it will take away from my bill money. This is my *highest* funding priority.

---

Savings accounts:

- The Egg: Nothing ever comes out of the egg. Ever. And I mean EVER. If my car breaks down, then oh well, I'm fucked, because nothing's coming out of this bitch. This account is never getting touched. Money goes in, nothing comes out. Period. This has to be absolutely sacrosanct. I actually had it in a CD in mid-2019 when I wasn't sure of my discipline, but I've held true. 

- Business Savings: I have all my business accounts blacked out in the screenshot because they have my business name. But this account is to hold my estimated tax payments. It's really difficult when you're self employed and are being asked to set aside 15% of everything you make and then just.... uh, hold on to it. When disaster strikes and you need money, it's very tempting to just use your tax money. But that will definitely come back to bite you in the ass in April. I learned this in 2018 when I owed $7,000 on my tax return. Having to pay that $7k is what wiped out my egg for the LAST time. Therefore, if I want my egg to remain sacrosanct, then I need to keep up with my tax savings. I pay quarterly now, to avoid any unnecessary temptations.

- Asset Savings: This is one of the best ideas I had. To support keeping The Egg sacrosanct, I created this savings account. Ally has 'buckets' for your saving accounts (this is a fairly new feature) that lets you allocate funds to certain things. My asset savings account is for three things: Cat, Car, Medical. It's not very high right now, but that's okay. Every month, I add more to it. Knowing I have a fund to pay for a vet/car repair/medical bill will help me avoid draining my egg. Remember, that sucker is sacrosanct!

- Contractor Savings: This is just where I keep funds for paying contractors through my work. It's a long story, but this money isn't actually mine, I'm just holding it until the jobs are complete. Years ago, this would have been another terrible temptation, but now I only spend out of my Slush account, nothing else. 

Honestly, having a ton of accounts helps a lot. Every time I get paid, I get out my calculator and start slicing it up. I know how much I need in my bill account each month. I know how much needs to go into my tax account (15% of everything). I always drop $20 into Asset Savings, and then what's left over is a fight to the death between Slush and Egg. 

Egg always wins!

I'm not sure if this is actually helpful. I know a lot of people here are fighting debt, and I'll be honest, I have zero debt. I've worked really hard throughout my life to remain debt-free. I have one credit card that I just use for Netflix and Hulu subscriptions (they autopay out of my Bills account), for the sole purpose of keeping my credit high. Other than that, I hate credit and buy nothing on it, ever.

The biggest thing I've learned is probably that, the more money you have saved, the easier it is to save it. It's really easy to see $100 in your savings account and use it for new tires. You haven't set yourself back much, it's not a huge hit, psychologically. But when the account is at $10k, you start seeing it as something really unbelievable and (I know I'm saying this a lot, sorry) sacrosanct. You're way less likely to view it as an alternate source of spending, if that makes sense.

Anyway, I hope this at least gives someone some new budgeting ideas!",t2_29bbctjl,False,,0,False,Not a victory post - A 'what I did' post!

,povertyfinance,"Hello everyone. First time posting here, so sorry if my post isn't appropriate for the sub. 

My parents are moving to a different state, leaving me behind here, due to their financial difficulties. I found out before the pandemic, and had an apprenticeship exam as well as a job, so I figured things would be alright. However, because of the pandemic, the exam was postponed and the job was paused because it was not essential. Right now I'm doing all I can to get a job, filed for unemployment, waiting for a recruiter to get back to me about a manufacturing position at a medical company.

I'm honestly lost. I do have a car(good reliable used honda accord) so I have a method of transportation. I will be unable to live with family because of either their own situations or the unclean environment in their house(my parents and many family members are hoarders)

One of the biggest issues honestly is my pet snake. I've had her for years now, she's basically my best friend. I got her because I needed a cheap companion, and she requires such low maintenance that I at most spend about 50 bucks per year to keep her alive and happy. The issue is, well, she lives in a tank, and if I live anywhere and want to keep her, I'll have to bring her. Either I find someone to house her for a while until I find a permanent place, or I sell/rehome her. Most likely, a friend will take her in for a while, and I'm completely willing to live in my car if it means my snake will have a good home.

I also have significant mental health problems, currently being treated with medication and therapy, and I'm worried what will happen if that ever gets limited. 

Sorry, this was kind of a rambling post. I'm lost. I thought I had a plan as to what to do when my parents left, but the pandemic has slowed everything down. I'm applying for jobs every week but so is everyone else. I also just filed for unemployment but it'll be a while until I get any benefits, if I get any at all. Please give some advice if you can.

Please give some advice if you can. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Hello Reddit, I am posting on behalf of my husband. For the past 10 years, my husband has lived with excruciating dental pain. he does not have insurance, and he works for a small company that does not provide insurance. Because of his full-time status, we have been denied for Medicaid dental.

The issue with his teeth, is that the wisdom teeth grew in sideways. They cracked all of the teeth in front of them. He now needs a total of 10 teeth removed, all of them actually being shards of teeth, not full teeth.

His gums are a mixture of green, yellow, and black. He has gotten repeated infections due to this, and has had to go to the emergency room each time for antibiotics. We have been unable to pay any of those emergency room visits.

In addition to attempting to get Medicaid, we have also called our local dental college. The dental college said they would be able to take the shards out, not the wisdom teeth which is fine, but they were actually wanting to charge even more than Aspen dental. This would cost us around $1,000, and they would expect payment upfront. We cannot afford that, we could only afford around $500, which would be our rent money for the month. We would eventually have to pay that rent money back.

If anyone knows any extremely cheap or reduced dental care in the greater St Louis Missouri area (we live in Alton, IL), we would really appreciate any guidance. I am at a complete loss. And I am terrified that I'm going to lose my husband due to an infection.

I have health insurance through my employer. It is reasonably priced for my coverage at around 60 per paycheck + something like 12 per paycheck for dental. When I last checked, for some reason adding a a spouse made it jump from 60 per paycheck to like.. 400!! Holy hell!

I shopped around and it seems like all the marketplace plans are something like 200-300 a month, which is still a lot...

OHP has an option, and if she applies as an individual (she makes 800/mo) she is applicable but I am still super confused about it all.

I make 2400 before taxes a month (1600 after taxes and deductions etc) and she makes 800.. As a legal couple it seems we are still a make too much even though we really do struggle, especially as her 800$ a month is unreliable income (nothing illegal, just personal.)

All the information about plans is really hard to comb through. It confuses me and I feel like I must be missing something... Does anyone have any good resources for seeing the best deals dor health insurance for people in OR, or USA, married or unmarried, etc?

,povertyfinance,"I'm fortunate to be receiving unemployment, inc the extra $600 a week, while my spouse is considered essential so has been kept working in addition to getting the stimulus money.  I realize we are very fortunate to be in this situation and do not want to mess this opportunity up.

I also know that things can change in an instant.  Ex. we are waiting to hear if spouse will need a corrective surgery that would leave them unable to work for 6 weeks, and although my job says they'll call me back there's not guarantee of when or what hours I'll get - good chance it'll be too much to get any unemployment but less than what I was making.  In other words, I'm not worried about this month's bills, but have definite reason to worry about what may happen.

And I know me.  We're trying to pay off massive debt and having that money just sitting there it's so tempting to either spend it or pay off debt with it and be hurting for it later.

So I came up with 8 different funds (homes) for it to go into.  I have one each for ""Short Paycheck"", ""College Tuition"", ""Emergency"", ""Car Repair"", ""Christmas"", ""Home Projects"", ""Birthdays"", and ""Fun"".

I divided the amount I currently have extra (and all future extra amounts that come in) by a percent I assigned to each category (Short Paycheck and Emergency getting the biggest percentages, Birthdays and Fun the smallest).    I also set a maximum amount for each so that when/if a fund reaches that amount, then the remainder will go as extra payment on debt.

End result - I'm finally at peace with knowing I'm not going to waste this extra money and that I have some handle on any income/spending issues that may come up as time goes on.  

We're continuing to pay what we were before on our debt so it's still going down, and this is in addition to the small amount we already had in an emergency fund before all this started.

,povertyfinance,"Hey Reddit,

Long time listener, first time caller. It's a complicated situation, so I'll try to be concise, and I appreciate any insight that the community can offer.

**Overview:** 29 F renting a 3-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles with two other young women. The property management company is trying to screw us with two different, unfair charges (that they've been lumping into one lump sum). One charge is Paypal fees that were accrued by paying our rent via Paypal the ""wrong"" way (and thus having Paypal take transaction fees out of the payment); the other charge is failing to pay our rent increase for three months for a rent increase that we were never notified of. When initially hit with this notification of charges, we wrote a reply e-mailing refusing to pay the charges; in our most recent e-mail from management, they say that they will take these charges out of our security deposit if we do not pay.

I am wondering how we can fight back. My instinct is to maybe take the property management company to small claims court... am I barking up the wrong tree? The current amount they are trying to charge us for is $1100 (even though their calculations are wrong, and change with every notification).

Here are my questions:

1. Is small claims court the right action and, if not, what other options do you think I have?
2. If I go to small claims court, should I sue for both charges at once, or treat the two separate charges as separate cases?
3. Timing: if I go to small claims court, should we sue now or after we move out, and the money is actually withheld from us? (We have no intention of moving out anytime soon.)
4. If I go to small claims court, who do I sue - the landlord or the property management company? (I assume the latter? All of our communications have been with the property management company via their company e-mail, but the signature on it is always the same one employee... who, as far as I can tell, is inept at his job and passing the literal buck onto us).

**Details - Rent Increase:** The first notification re: deficient payment for rent increase was sent to us Nov. 11th, 2019. They wrote: *""For property* ***\[address redacted\]****. Your rent was increased to* ***$\[redacted\]*** ***from*** ***$\[redacted\]*** *starting the month of July 2019.""* The kicker is, we did not pay this increase because none of us knew about it. None of the three of us were notified via e-mail or snail mail, at all.... however, I'm not sure how to prove this? An absence of something isn't exactly easy to prove legally.

**Details - Paypal charges:** I am going to go into details here about the timeline of communication  regarding Paypal; however, I am wondering if it's a moot point because at the end of the day, the company should not be using Paypal to collect rent. (It is in clear violation of Paypal's user agreement for businesses to use Paypal as a ""personal"" account, which is what the company was directing us to do.) I will go into these details in case that information is helpful for anybody.

 The first tenant who was responsible for paying rent did it for the group via Wells Fargo. When she moved out in summer 2018, the next tenant  (L) started doing it via Paypal. After a month or two of doing this she received notice from the company that they were being charged a fee:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think you should contact paypal and find out what happened so that it doesn't happen again.All other tenants rent comes through without any fees taken out as it should.

Wow... thank you landlord for these clear instructions.

What they were trying to communicate with us was that L had sent the money using the ""Send money"" function (which treats the recipient as a business and charges a fee) as opposed to the ""Send Gift"" option (which treats the recipient as a friend/family and allows the transaction to go through without a fee). (HOWEVER, this was not actually clarified to us until the following year, which I'll get to in a second.)

We started paying via check around June 2018 and just dropping it off.

Fast forward to January 2019 when we start paying electronically again.  Everything is going along fine (or so we think), for months and months. Fast forward again to Nov. 2019 when we receive notification from our property management company that we owed them $816 -- a mix of charges from the ""delinquent"" raised rent charges, and Paypal fees that had accrued over the past year. This was the **first time** since Jan 2019 that they notified us that we were not paying correctly, even though we had been doing it ""incorrectly"" (on and off) ever since then.

We dispute the charges and receive word back that they are going to waive the rent increase disparity but still want the Paypal charge $$; we write back and refuse.

We receive no word (thinking that they have capitulated, and that the matter is wrapped up) until March 2020 when they write back and say ""We just wanted to let you know that if the payment is not received, we will charge the Full Total Listed Amount from your Security Deposit.""

**A little detail to complicate matters:** in almost every notification they have given us, their math shifts. It goes from a \~$500 amount to a \~$800 amount to a \~$1100 amount. Their current estimate (based on the March 2020 correspondence) is $1146, a number that they arrived at by (I'm pretty sure) double charging us the $95 Paypal fee. (The list it first as a discrepancy within the total rent payment, because presumably the owner is seeing it as a lower amount on her end, then list it AGAIN as a separate Paypal charge.)

I just want to have a long-term, clean, sustainable solution for getting this idiot property management company off of my back... how should I proceed?

In this last year I bought a new round of mattresses for the house,  last round was 10 years ago. So 10 years ago the best deals I could find were $600 for a queen and $500 for a full.  Due to the bed in a box innovation  this time around I got a king (we've gained weight) for $329 and a full for $165. They are both both hybrid coil and foam and they have been awesome!

I also bought a metal frame platform for each for about $100 each so that does away with the squeaky box and frame and allows for better storage underneath.  

I wanted to share this because I suffered with that stupid queen bed for longer than I should have because I had it in my head that beds were terribly expensive.

Our apartment 3 bedroom for 1 month was $4300 ( rounding numbers up )

roommate 1. put in 700

roommate 2. put in 700

and I roommate 3 put in $2900. ( I had bad credit and they said we had to have a bigger deposit to secure the lease )

At the end of our lease they screwed us over but anyway...

they charged us $2700 for the damages.

So we got a check for $1545. How do we split this check fairly?

Can you please explain how to calculate the amount that each roommate should get back and why? we are having a disagreement. Thank you so much

also:

they charged us $1800 to paint the entire apartment because the living room had black marks everywhere and some of the rooms had black marks and stickers..

650 for patching the walls

and 250 for house keeping

We ask them to provide us with the paint color so we can fix it ourselves. They said they cannot give the paint color unless its to a professional insured painter. And the only way we can do it ourselves is to hire a professional and have him ask for the paint.

We said well how much will you charge us "" he said i wont screw you guys over wont be more than $1k"" but he charged us $1800...

,povertyfinance,"Hello! Hope everyone is staying safe!

Just wanted to post here and say I’m almost done with paying off all the credit debts I have!! Please let me know if this is not the right sub.

About 1.5 years ago I had around 12k credit debts from multiple credit cards (due to irresponsible spending habits, paying barely over the min payments, etc). 

When I finished my undergrad couple years ago and was preparing for grad school, I knew I had to do something about this debt since I’ll be paying all of my grad program with loans.

Since then I have been trying to aggressively pay off by budgeting and working 2-3 part time jobs (since I don’t live with my parents I also had to pay for rent and everything).

Sometimes I would feel depressed when I see all my hard working go straight to paying off my past mistakes, but I’m glad I learned a lesson before it was too late! Feel like me working 70 hrs/week for almost a year was really worth it.

I’m down to the very last 3k that I should be able to pay within 2-3 months. I gotta admit, it feels weird thinking that I won’t need to make those credit payments soon!!!

,povertyfinance,"Long story short, I grew up in an extremely traumatic home with parents who were in financial trouble long before they had kids. My mom was disabled and my dad worked on/off. There was abuse and neglect. I was a very aloof kid and I spent a lot of time daydreaming. Then I turned 18 and went to college because all of my friends were doing it.

,povertyfinance,"The past almost 2 months now have been crazy. 

For the first months of 2020, my fiancé and I were slowly paying off our debts. He was working to get certified at his new job that comes with a pay raise, and I was doing really well at my job. 

Our plan was to pay the final payments in March, and then we would be on our way to saving and getting our own place. I was also finally going to be able to go back to school this summer. 

Then everything got crazy, I was laid off, we had to move from our house into my dads house, my fiancé’s hours were cut at work, we found out my car tires were dry rotting and my wheel bearing was about to break, and I started experiencing health problems. 

I’ve known since I was 12 I had thyroid problems, but never did anything about it until recently. I think how stressed out I was on top of a lot of other things finally made the problems worse. 

I was dealing with exhaustion, fainting, muscle aches, my entire chest and arms would go numb and tingly, I would feel short of breath, and have panic attacks because I was afraid of fainting. 

I was able to see somebody and they think it’s either Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. 

I applied for unemployment in March and was desperate to get it so that I could take this break from work, fix my car, and get my health back to normal before I go back to working full time again. 

I waited, and stressed, and waited, and it never came. I would spend hours a day trying to get into contact with anybody at the unemployment offices and nobody ever answered. 

It wasn’t until a week ago that they let you see the status of your application without calling. It said I was approved but they were waiting to hear from my employer. 

They finally put 3 weeks of money into my account last night, and my fiancé gets paid tomorrow. It’s the most money I’ve EVER had. 

I can get my tires fixed, we can pay off the debt we had to hold off on paying, we even have enough money to buy one nice thing for ourselves,and we can put the rest in savings. I don’t have to worry about having the co pay for my doctors visit this week!!

,povertyfinance,"I’m in a fortunate spot as I haven’t lost any income from the pandemic and I don’t anticipate doing so. I work for the state government and my workload has only slightly slowed down. 

I fully expect the economic woes to trickle down to everyone, and  for me that’s most likely going to look like raised property taxes on my house and not getting a pay raise at the end of the year.


Other than working from home with no childcare (which has been very challenging) I’ve actually been better off financially considering I received my stimulus check and I’m saving ~$600/month in childcare costs. To be honest, I’ve been feeling a little survivors guilt.


The more I read the more I believe that the economy will be getting significantly worse before it gets better. I’m obviously speculating heavily but my guess is that we will gain a false sense of confidence over the warmer summer months and then the cold autumn weather will hit us hard with another spike in covid cases. 


Either way, just because I’ve been fortunate so far does not mean things can’t change as quickly and unexpectedly for me as it has for millions of others so I was hoping to prepare accordingly. 


I make ~50k/year and I’m a single parent with 2 kids (3 &amp; 9). I paid off some credit card debt with my stimulus but otherwise set it aside. 


I get by decently on my income alone but I still rely heavily on each individual paycheck. while I do save some, it’s usually 100-200/month. So I have a little bit of an emergency fund at the moment but it wouldn’t last me very long. 


Besides the obvious (set as much money aside as a precaution) is there anything else that others are doing to prepare for the economy crashing even more? NPR put out a story today that this is just the tip of the iceberg and I’d like to make sure I’m in the best position possible to weather the storm.

,povertyfinance,"TL:DR my wife and I got covid and I was replaced at my job due to my absence. Now because of an error on their part, we owe the unemployment office over a thousand dollars and won't be receiving any more aid. 

So I......well I used to be a real estate photographer. I was working as an independent contractor for a local photography company. Until my wife and I started developing symptoms of covid 19. At that point I informed my boss that I need to take myself off the schedule and that I will let him know when I've been cleared to go back to work. 

My wife immediately started walking us through the process of filing for unemployment. My unemployment was approved based on the income I had received when I worked for an animal hospital over a year prior. We began receiving checks and then the extra stimulus of 600/week was added on top of it. We were living quite comfortably on this and my wife's teachers wages. Since I was also in school we were used to me working less we were even enjoying being able to invest in ourselves and our home. The money was used quickly to begin paying down loans and buying equipment that we both needed for our side hustles. 

My wife was then hit hard by covid and we went to the emergency room. This was extremely scary for a number of reasons, the main being that she was having trouble breathing, coughing a lot and had extreme temperatures and confusion.  I wasn't allowed to go with her and when I dropped her off and was forced to leave I thought I may never see my wife again. She was processed through and given a few medications to take and luckily was determined to be well enough to go home. 

She was not officially diagnosed with covid....... Reason being was that the hospital was out of tests. Instead her official diagnosis was pneumonia, but she was advised to follow the guidelines as if she had been diagnosed with covid.........

We couldn't afford for me to be seen, however I had been experiencing lighter symptoms but still had a fever, fatigue and a cough. 

Let me be perfectly clear. There's not a single doubt in my mind that we certainly had the pandemic virus. 

Because neither of us were officially diagnosed with covid, I wasn't allowed to list that in our unemployment. 

It took us almost 5 weeks until we were both symptom free. It was then that we were informed that there had been an error in our unemployment and not only were we no longer going to be receiving it, but that we had to pay everything we had received back to the state. The reason being that my last w-2 employer, the pet hospital had been paying our unemployment out of their trust. This was due to an error on the states part, because they approved our application despite the fact that I provided the information that I had willingly separated from that company. Our appeal isn't until late May.....

Shortly after that, according to the covid guidelines, I'm okay to go back to work. So I message my boss at the real estate photography company and tell him that I'm good to go back on the schedule. He informed me (after about 5 days of ignoring me) that I'd been replaced due to my absence and that I have to return all of the gear he's lent me. Just like that, out of the blue. I get it......but damn. 

Oh also our cat died of cancer and we were home the whole time to watch. He was only two years old. 

I could go back to driving for Lyft but from what I've been reading it's fully dead right now because no one is going anywhere......

Feeling fully fucking shat on by the world right now. Not sure what to do.

,povertyfinance,"I was laid off due to “lack of business” on April 2nd. I filed for unemployment immediately. Though I guess it doesn’t take effect until the following Sunday, whatever day that is, in my case it was April 5th. I had a phone interview yesterday, leading up to it I was preparing. Wondering what in the world they would ask. They asked about 4-5 questions, extremely basic, so I was worried for nothing. They said they would have a decision in 7-10 days. Anyone else have a similar situation? How did that just happen now when I was laid off and filed basically 4 weeks ago? Just millions of people in the same situation I guess that’s causing this delay? 

Anyway, I’m just a little nervous because I have $6,204.53 total saved up. The next few upcoming days of the month I’ll have bills due, so I’ll take a nice little hit there. Just worried I guess with the whole uncertainty of when I’ll get my unemployment debit card/ payment etc.

Oil is .90 cheaper a gallon now than it was in November. I believe that the price is going to start going back up in June and will probably be back at 2019 prices by the fall. If we get 300 gallons now we will save $270!&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Throw away account

I was furloughed from my job in the healthcare industry 6 weeks ago because of COVID-19 and I have been receiving unemployment from both the state and federal government. I am currently receiving more money from unemployment, even after taxes, than I was making at my current job working 40 hours. They are only offering me 30 hours right now, but working 30 hours would put me over the limit for being eligible for unemployment. The extra money the past few weeks has helped my husband and I out tremendously to pay on past due debt and to put a little away into savings. I’m having a difficult time right now trying to figure out what to do about my job. Unemployment won’t last forever, I know, but the opportunity to have a higher income even temporarily has been our saving grace. How do I move forward without putting my husband and I back into a tight spot with our finances?

Edit: Thank you all for your comments. I know the right thing to do is to go back to my job with the hours available and then either negotiate a raise or find something that pays more.

,povertyfinance,"Background Story: Over a year ago I was 11k in debt on a single credit card. Having multiple credit cards always scared me so stuck to the only one I had since I was 18 I am 30 now. I dealt with the high interest rate and irresponsible spending until about a year ago when I finally said enough is enough. I would scroll down r/povertyfinance and see other people posting their success stories and it really motivated me to make some life changes. 

About a year ago I was offered a really good paying job and knew that this was my chance to finally make a dent on this balance. I prioritized a certain amount every month to this card and completely stopped using it. I moved back to my parents for a year to save a little on rent and continue this cycle of always putting that certain amount into my card. This also meant saying NO to outings you knew you can’t afford. Finally last week I was able to pay it off!!! I can now add what was going to that card and apply it to my savings. The feeling is a little serial but I honestly want to say thank you!! And Hopefully this motivates others to make similar changes. 

Couple tips I wish I knew:
- Educate yourself on credit card options and money transfers (interest rates can be your downfall)
- Sacrifices have to be made. 
- Tell your self enough is enough it’s never too late to make a difference.
- Learn to say NO! I made the mistake of of trying to live a lifestyle I knew I couldn’t afford. This meant saying no to friends and family who were always out and about.

Before this pandemic, my weekly checks were 350 dollars. My monthly bills were 920, not counting food or gas or golly gee just the occasional once or twice a month eating out. You guys can do the math there.

Never take vacations. Literally ever. No time or money for them.

Now I'm getting almost 1000 bucks a week... to just sit on my ass. For the first time in 16 years.

""Problem"" is, my boss wants to open back up next week... and I'm sitting here really wanting to continue ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO SAVE MONEY to pay off my crippling school debts.

,povertyfinance,"At first i wasn't sure about posting this because my context isn't the one of someone in a first world country, but hopefully you can still give me some advice or insight.

I live in a country of south america with a financial crisis going on due to the highest hyperinflation in the world. Two years ago I was living alone and studying in college, but suddenly my father lost his job so I moved back home and enrolled in another university while working part-time. After a while the crisis increased and he decided to move abroad so he could help us with more money. Unfortunately that didn't work for him, at the end he decided to settle there and is living his life with a minimum wage paycheck to paycheck.

On the other hand, due to the situation I had to stop college again to work full time in the company, teaching in a private languages institute. I considered myself kind of lucky because i was making one way more than many professionals here and certainly more than I could have made trying to find another job with my curriculum. It was ok because I was earning in dollars and most of jobs were paying with the national currency, which is literally nothing. 

So, I spent 2019 like that; working hard, got a promotion and was earning almost enough to pay all the basic bills in my household, but feeling completely miserable because of how demanding and time consuming it was in comparison with what I was earning, which was around $350 dollars a month. Take into account that I don't have to pay rent and all the services here are extremely cheap. 

On december I was expecting to get paid something for vacations but it didn't happen so I tried an idea online and made $700 in a week (merely luck) so I just spent the whole month resting and enjoying life again. During those days made the decision to quit, but on january they offered me managing a department and i accepted because I thought that it would be useful to have that experience. Then again, I was selling my soul to the devil because I had to wait a while until I could start working as the manager.

Now we get to the present: covid-19 happened and the company stopped working since quarantine started. That job was my only source of income. I was living week to week with $45 and I didn't have any money in that moment. So the first day of quarantine I quickly started to work online, set daily and weekly goals. First week made $160 and closed the month with $795 as savings in my account. I spent $80-$100 weekly. 

So, first week of next month was good, I hit $1200 and i decided it was a good moment to invest. I enrolled in a trading academy for $235 to learn and work with binary options, they also have a network marketing system but I'm not into that. Just started a few days ago, up until know i've just been studying about it. 

I'm very good at saving money, but I just want to try to make more money online and then invest it. So, here are some of my questions: 

1) being in my position, would you invest money in something?

2) do you consider it's better for me to bring some products from china and then running an online business here In my country?

,povertyfinance,"Okay, I had a baby in February and finally received all billing from last year and this year. My hospital stay and pregnancy costs are a little over $6k, my son’s are a little over $2k. I established a payment plan for about $112/mo for myself last month for my costs and called today to set up my son’s. I ask if I could but their balances together and I am told no, that because we are different patients, it will have to stay as different accounts. Fair enough. So I pay my payment plan and ask to set up his. They tell me his payments will about $100/mo. I ask if that can be lower and she says $69 is the lowest she can go. Okay, so I whip out my HSA card and ask to pay down the balance $500 to make my payments lower per month. She agrees. I make the payment and ask her for the new amount. She tells me $90. Apparently, they can’t allow that new balance to extend longer than 24 mo and the monthly payment can’t be lowered. The previous balance was high enough to qualify for their longer term plan. So frustrating!! 

What are some options I can move forward with? I have about $900 left on my HSA card. Should I pay off his balance as much as possible and ask for another payment plan? If I do that, she said my monthly payment will be around $60 a month, but honestly $112 + $60 is a little too much right now. I honestly asked to pay $50 and she told me that was not possible and I would be sent to collections. I am under this impression that if I am paying something they cannot send to collections?

If I do that, she said my monthly payment will be around $60 a month, but honestly $112 + $60 is a little too much right now. I honestly asked to pay $50 and she told me that was not possible and I would be sent to collections. I am under this impression that if I am paying something they cannot send to collections? Is this correct or something that doesn’t apply to all medical debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice or suggestions are appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance," TL;DR: Lost my health insurance due to non payment. Looking for steps/advice to get insured

So, today I found out I lost my health insurance. Apparently I had it terminated at the start of the year, but I had made payments for January, February, and March thinking I was still insured through the marketplace. I had been one month behind on payments since early 2019, but never received any indication that my insurance was cancelled, or about to be cancelled. Obviously this is my fault for not staying caught up, but I could have handled it sooner if they had told me I was paying on nothing for the past three months.

As of now my policy has been terminated since January, and cannot be reinstated. What's more, there is no special enrollment through the marketplace because I lost my insurance due to non payment. This year has been better for me financially and I'd been saving and working when the pandemic started (I was going to be debt free by December). I've also received my stimulus check and am receiving unemployment after my job was closed by the state due to the virus. I have no spouse or children.

I need to know my next steps. I've never had insurance through a job before and I've never paid for insurance out of pocket other than Obamacare (Marketplace). My insurance company is sending me back the money I paid this year, and I have savings to work with. Basically I need to know what steps I need to take in order to get insured between now and Nov. 1st when open enrollment starts again.

,povertyfinance,"Hey Guys, need a bit of advice from the community. I have a 2014 Lexus GS 350 with about 64k miles on it. I owe about $16800 at 4.6%. KBB valued it as a trade between 16-18k. Carmax offered me 14.5k for it and auto nation offered $16k. My payments are about $375/Month and I have about 52 months (officially) but I’ve been making extra payments so it should be less. 

We recently moved down south because my wife got a new job but I’m now permanently working from home so We don’t really need two cars. 
I am also considering leasing a new car in about 3 months or so since I no longer drive much but still need a car. 
Here’s my options: 

1. Keep the car till it dies and keep making the payments (By the time it’s paid off it’ll be 9-10 years old)

2. Sell the car to the dealership that offered 16K and pay off the negative equity. 

3. Trade it in and roll the negative equity into a lease (don’t want to do that as I want to keep my lease payments as low as possible)


FYI, it’s hard to sell privately since the title is held by the bank back up North and they don’t have a brand down there. Also, it’s an electronic title held at the DMV and takes about a week to be sent once the car is released.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade it in and roll the negative equity into a lease (don’t want to do that as I want to keep my lease payments as low as possible)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI, it’s hard to sell privately since the title is held by the bank back up North and they don’t have a brand down there. Also, it’s an electronic title held at the DMV and takes about a week to be sent once the car is released. I am very doubtful that someone is willing to pay off my loan without the the title in hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Hello, Reddit!

I had a credit card opened with Capital One for about 2 years. Unfortunately, I failed to make payments which eventually led to them terminating the card and selling off the credit. 

For the past couple months I’ve had the debt collector calling me, stating that $4,327 is owed. I’ve been looking at settling this debt and getting it scrubbed from my credit report.

So here’s the weird part. I checked all three of my credit reports today but there was no information on the defaulted card, my debt that was sent to collections, or any pertaining information to this line of credit.

The line was opened in 2017 and closed in January of 2020. I wasn’t contacted by the debt collector until late February or so.

Typically, would it take a minute for the debt to to reflect on my credit report? I’m kind of stumped. 

I know debt just doesn’t go away but I don’t want to contact the debt collector until I have this figured out.

Also, if you have any tips for settling then I’d really appreciate it.

,povertyfinance,"Hello everyone, I am a 24 year old guy and I live in Bolivia, well maybe not many know my country but the truth is that we are considered third world countries and in fact I do not deny that until now I have many problems to get ahead financially.

My story is the following, I obtained my baccalaureate at 18 and because there was no way to get a good level education from my parents I started working and 2 years ago I managed to save enough money to enter a private university in good level here in my country continuing to work and paying my expenses.

Now I am in quarantine in my room for more than 4 weeks and the previous week a friend who is supplying medical supplies for some governorates of my country offered me to help him find suppliers of these products and earn a commission. I have been helping him this whole week and the truth is that I managed to earn enough for my groceries this week and I like it since I was beginning to get stressed out about not knowing when I can return to work.

The fact is that today my friend comes to see me and tells me that he has a client who orders him 1 million masks in the United States or to import them there and tells me that if I do a good job the commission that would leave me would totally change the lifetime.

Now I do not know how things are being carried in the US and I do not know if doing this type of things at this level is legal since until now I have been in charge of 500-1000 units and the prices seem reasonable to me.

I am sure my friend is not joking, he is a very well connected guy, only he lacks support with technology and internet search but I have the following questions.

1- Is it legal to buy that amount of masks?

2- Is it possible to buy that amount of masks all together in the US?

,povertyfinance,"Hello! I spent the past year unemployed while finishing college and have now been working a low-wage job for the past 3 months. I'm ""essential personnel"" and get enough hours currently to afford all my bills with very little left over.

There is no one in my life that is terribly smart with money, myself included, so I'm turning to you. Without further ado, the questions:

1) I have two credit cards. One is -1400 at about 11% and the other is -4500 at 24%. Does it make more sense to a) pay both credit card bills separately or to b) put both bills' worth of payments on the smaller card with the lower interest rate and do a monthly balance transfer to ""pay"" the bigger card? I can afford both payments and am doing ~20 dollars extra on both. The balance transfer fee is 3%.

2) re:the stimulus check. Two of my bills can be paid for months advance. Does it make sense to pay those now (6 months will cost about 400 dollars) and reduce my monthly bills, or should I keep paying them with my monthly income and put the whole check into my savings account?

,povertyfinance,"i don't like to talk about it with most people in my personal life, but it's finally gone! I am paying on a mortgage, but have absolutely no other debt than that.

I got my first credit card at 16. I grew up poor. potatoes for every meal for days, seeing your breath in bed and waking up to frozen glasses of water, not being able to shower before school some days poor. i looked at it like free money. it was partially used for groceries and helping the family for sure, but i was also extremely irresponsible and bought computer parts, useless junk, etc. by the time i was 20 i had $10,000 in credit card debt and nothing to show for it.

i just managed it for 10 years. paying minimums but keeping all my available credit maxed. at it's peak i owed 16k. also at that time i owed the irs about 45k (that was settled through an offer in compromise). that was a depressing couple of years. i had pretty much accepted i would be in debt my entire life and lived under that assumption.

i don't know exactly what changed. i mean a lot changed(job, location, S/O), but i don't know where my attitude regarding debt changed. i know it was at least partially due to the posts and guidelines i would read on here. i never followed religiously but whenever i had a question this was my first resource to answer it.

but eventually i just started paying more than the minimum. then after reading about the snowball method here i tried it with my highest rate card, and it was paid off in less than a year. it was only $1k balance, but the effect it had mentally got me hooked.

definitely gamified it. got a card with points back, started cycling the balance on that while i only paid off the other cards.

5 years later i have paid them all off, have about a month's pay saved, and am looking into saving and investing what i had been paying off debt with every month.

when did i become an adult?

,povertyfinance,"Hey guys, title basically says it all. My mother was working a job making around 35k/yr which she lost on April 1st due to COVID. She's applied for unemployment and will be getting the extra $600 a week. But talking to her more about the situation I learned the unfortunate truth of her current financial situation, as she apparently has accrued almost 30K in credit card debt...again. Now currently, her total monthly expenses is hundreds of dollars more a month than her unemployment income (before the extra $600/week), and was probably just as terrible before losing her job.

She previously consolidated her past 20kish of CC debt into her mortgage a few years ago, and has now racked up around 28k of new CC debt in the last decade or so. 

I'm worried she has basically screwed herself over for the rest of her life, as she also has no retirement savings. I've tried calculating out how she can get the extra unemployment money to try and pay down some of her debt, but her monthly expenses will still be larger than her unemployment income. 

I've also been looking into debt consolidation options, but they apparently tank your credit as well. 

**Breakdown: Monthly**

Mortgage: $603/month ($78718.1 left) - Current home value ~$210k

Car payment: $250/month ($3070.25 left)

**Total Monthly Expenses: $2,556.45‬**

**Monthly: Unemployment Income (without extra $600/week): $1572**

**NET MONTHLY DEFICIT: $984.45**

Obviously I've talked to her about reducing TV/Internet bill and groceries. But I don't think she can reduce her phone bill while paying for her current device, and can't get rid of that car payment unless she sells it, and she will need the car when looking for a job/working at whatever new job she lands. But even with those cuts, she is still running a deficit every month and I'm not sure how to dig her out of it. I just bought my own home on the other side of the country, and I can't really go by to help her out.

&lt;p&gt;If it helps any, at my job I would have been making 200ish dollars a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I’m in South Carolina. Also the 113 makes sense for just regular unemployment benefits. But because of covid, I thought I was supposed to receive 600 dollars on top of that&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"How do I get my life back on track?

Throwaway here... I made a bit of a mess out of my financial life and am really just now starting to see how bad the situation is. I am 22 years old and in 35k of credit card debt with an average 23% APR. 

If I did the math correctly, that’s just shy of $700 a month in interest. Wow. That REALLY hits home.

I have decided to take the first step and admit that there’s a huge problem with my finances. On top of this CC debt, I also owe around 11k in student loans for a degree I have yet to finish. I’m currently working full time but getting to the point where I can go back to school is a top priority for me. 

Would I be making a huge mistake by “borrowing” the max allowable amount ($10,000) from my 401k just to make the interest on the CC less crazy? I have even considered taking a loan on my car that I own outright (valued at around 26k) just so I can apply the balance to my CC. If I were to do both of these moves, I would be able to completely eliminate the high interest credit card debt.

,povertyfinance,"So this if my first ever post, but I'm really not sure where else to look. Some basic info about me; I'm a junior in college, grew up basically homeless, and somehow swindled my way into a prestigious private university where I basically get paid to go to college. Anyway I work part time (1 year and 8 months at my current job), as well as go to college for finance. I buy everything on credit cards (and pay them off every single day i make a purchase), and largely due to that I have a credit score (according to BofA), of 760 exactly. I've also taken out a loan for a dirt bike a year ago because my dad was dying and I impulse purchased it (but it's payed off as of next month in full). So anyway I make about 20k a year before taxes at my job (pay is great but hours are tricky with schooling), and due to some natural disasters my mother and I are going to have to start looking for some sort of housing. I really don't like the idea of renting even though I understand that it genuinely could make more financial sense for some people (possibly even myself), but I hate the idea of paying for something that I will never see any sort of return on at all. I've started looking at homes and since I've had to pay for utilities and food for myself for about the past 5-6 years now I'd say I'm pretty good at budgeting so I believe I could manage to afford a house up to 70k. I have 14k in savings but I really do not want to go into my savings too heavily because basically anything under 90k in the areas I'm interested in are going to require some elbow grease. I have no credit card debt, student loans are deferred after I graduate, and my total monthly expenses (not including utilities or mortgage), are about $255 and my monthly take home pay is between 1400-1500. I should also add that my long term girlfriend will be moving with me as well so that will help with the expenses a ton but the goal is to purchase something that I can afford on my own in case the relationship goes awry. Is there anyone out there that knows whether or not I will be eligible for a loan and if so what my price range is? I know I have the financial discipline to make whatever I have to work, but I genuinely do not know if I'm even eligible lol.

TLDR; 20k annual income, 760 credit score (not lying but BofA might not be the most accurate), 1.8 years of employment, 0 monthly debt payments, $255 monthly expenses (basically just car insurance and phone bill), and 14k in savings. Can I buy a house and if so how much can I afford?

,povertyfinance,"I have been poor my entire life, with no real role models when it came to saving money, budgeting or making good financial choices. My credit was shit before I was even 21 years old. I went to vocational school, got a decent paying job ($15ish or so in a LCOL area) but still lived paycheck to paycheck for years because of things like subprime auto lending leading to high ass car payments of $199/2wks, “rent to own” furniture sets because I couldn’t save $1000s (or even $100s for used sets) to buy in full. I took out loans that I, 50% of the time could not ending up paying back. I stopped getting a tax return because of my school loans.

I worked in an office I genuinely liked for about 8 months until 3/6/20 when I was unexpectedly fired for a number of strange reasons; one being that my perfume was too strong, and another being someone had overheard a conversation about me looking for another job (it was intended to be part time/overnight to dig myself out of my financial ditch). I won’t get super into all the details but I think anyone who’s been fired knows the anger/resentment/embarrassment that comes with it. And it happened at the worst possible time when all my bills were piling up. I was the lowest of lows. I was scared, I was exhausted. I had not felt that bad since my mom passed away in 2015. 

And then: I got a tax return because offsets were stopped. $2000. My UI got approved a month after I was fired, and I was back paid for the time I waited. $2200. The extra $600 was added because of CARES. $1800 for that so far. I got my stimulus check. $1200. 

I have never had this much money at the same time in my life. I will get $17,000+ from my state for the next 5 months. If the world is normal again, I plan to job hunt a month or so before those benefits end. As horrible as this has been, I feel like this is the turning point in my life where things can finally change for me. So far, I’ve caught up on my car payment, paid my rent, paid off my furniture (ugh), and paid off an apartment bill that’s been dragging my credit and renter’s history down. I have opened a savings account and stored $3,000 so far. I plan on putting most of what I get from UI into savings and buying nothing but groceries and essentials, but I need advice on what to do going forward. 

I have $8,000 left on my dumb car. A few other things on my credit bringing it down. School loans. I don’t know where to even begin but will never forgive myself if I fuck this up.

What do you do with your emergency fund? I keep 4-6 months of expenses in my bank savings account, which a pretty sizable amount. I think it makes sense to put the money to work but I still want to have access to it in case of emergencies.

,povertyfinance,"I made a huge mistake. My grandma convinced me to apply for Medicaid because I lost insurance when I got divorced and I make very little money. Turns out that when you make over the federal poverty line (which I do by like $200) they give you coverage for three months and then roll your plan over into a private health insurance. It’s Sunday so I can’t call as all the offices are closed. I’ve been googling the plan they selected for me and it looks like it’s going to cost me about $500/month. I can’t find a way to opt out of it. 

I currently split an apartment with my boyfriend ($770/mo + $170 utilities) and his friend will be moving in soon which will cover just the utilities while she figures out financial stuff. My phone bill is $90 and my grocery bill is $150. I make $1300/mo. I’m asking my friend to move in to help lower the rent but she is unemployed and can’t afford to chip in much. We just moved in and furnished the apartment. As a result I burned through a lot of my savings. I know I shouldn’t have now but I’ve been getting overtime at work and didn’t expect to have to take on such a high bill so soon. 

I’m freaking out. Should I cancel my phone plan and just use the WiFi at home? Should I ask my boyfriend to cover more of the rent and offer to do all the cooking and cleaning on exchange? My friend suggested a sugar daddy. I’m so scared.

Edit: When I called DHS (and waited on hold for an hour and a half) they first told me that I would have to pay for the private insurance and since it was private I wouldn't be able to get a quote. The representative recommended that I work fewer hours at my job so that I would qualify for medicaid again. Then she told me I could write an appeal to cancel my coverage but I would need to get a different private insurance or insurance through my job (which I can't do because despite working 30-40 hours a week I am still classified as part time) or call the private insurance company and cancel it there. I called the private company and they had no record of me but told me that if I didn't pay the premium it would be withheld from my tax refund. I then called DHS again and spoke to a different representative who told me to calm down and that it would in fact only cost me $13 per month and I would have no deductible.

&lt;p&gt;We’re in the stimulus check limbo camp. So the money should be there, but who knows when? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do? Would the credit card companies accept a payment plan of 10/mo? That’s about all we can do. Our credit is obviously shot. Would this be sufficient to get licensed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had some opportunities come up, but keep hitting bad luck. It’s unbelievable. Any advice or insight would be appreciated. We just need this break.&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Hey guys,


There's an online college I had come across a few years ago called Universityofthepeople.com. I promise, I do not work for them or am being paid to talk about them at all. Anyways, I heard about them through a Tedtalk by the founder a few years back. I went to the website thinking it was too good to be true. Alas, it was true, but unfortunately they only offered like 2 programs, ones that I wasn't very interested in. At the time, I was already in college, (at the end of getting my bachelor's degree) so I didn't pay them much mind and moved on with my life. Well today, I decided to google Free Online Colleges and they came up. Wow, what a difference, they have come so far. They've added more programs. They are accredited but do your homework and see if they're right for you. I know you have to pay for some fees here and there but they offer scholarships to cover them if you're truly dead broke &amp; who knows, you might benefit. Good luck guys, be strong.

,povertyfinance,"Hi guys! First post on this subreddit. I’m a lurker but decided to create an account. 

Question? I’m saving up for a vehicle but am also paying off credit card debts at the same time. Should I pay off just the minimum each month until I get enough savings for a car? I DID had a vehicle but I got into a wreck. So my monthly budget is $1,296.00  I get paid weekly under the table at $324. I get paid sometimes $325, $330 or sometimes I pick up more shifts and I get like $405 but I never budget more or less than $324 since I know I will always make that much. 

So for chase, I just finally paid off my minimum payment at $588.00. Haha that was just terrible but I’m glad now that my minimum will be wayyy less than 588 now due to me being current on my bill. My second credit card is $100 a month I’m on a payment plan on this card. My last card I only have 320 I need to pay off and I’ll be done. I’m planning on getting that card paid off at the end of May. 

Sooo for my monthly expenses I’m planning on spending 320 for my last card, minimum on my chase, 100 on my other credit card. $175 rent, $40 phone bill, $85 utilities and if roommates buy common household items I’ll chip in on that, $60 a month on my fur girl, $50 fun money, $50 Christmas/birthdays, 100 a month on gas and 120 a month on groceries. 

Because of the pandemic my brother hasn’t been working so he’s been letting me drive his car to and from work... so I fill up his tank every week 20 dollars.

First post on this subreddit. I’m a lurker but decided to create an account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question? I’m saving up for a vehicle but am also paying off credit card debts at the same time. Should I pay off just the minimum each month until I get enough savings for a car? I DID had a vehicle but I got into a wreck. So my monthly budget is $1,296.00  I get paid weekly under the table at $324. I get paid sometimes $325, $330 or sometimes I pick up more shifts and I get like $405 but I never budget more or less than $324 since I know I will always make that much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for chase, I just finally paid off my minimum payment at $588.00. Haha that was just terrible but I’m glad now that my minimum will be wayyy less than 588 now due to me being current on my bill. My second credit card is $100 a month I’m on a payment plan on this card. My last card I only have 320 I need to pay off and I’ll be done. I’m planning on getting that card paid off at the end of May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooo for my monthly expenses I’m planning on spending 320 for my last card, minimum on my chase, 100 on my other credit card. $175 rent, $40 phone bill, $85 utilities and if roommates buy common household items I’ll chip in on that, $60 a month on my fur girl, $50 fun money, $50 Christmas/birthdays, 100 a month on gas and 120 a month on groceries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the pandemic my brother hasn’t been working so he’s been letting me drive his car to and from work... so I fill up his tank every week 20 dollars. He is gonna be going back to work on the first of May so by then I’ll only be paying him $10 a week for gas.   I’m going to be putting aside a fourth of my expenses into an envelope every week starting the beginning of May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to see if it’s more feasible for me to save up for an emergency fund and a car before tackling my debt? I was supposed to get a vehicle for $500 but my brother in law changed his mind on selling it to me. And I’m hoping at one point or another I can get braces 😬.

,povertyfinance,"Hey everyone, it's been awhile. Just thought I'd share a little bit of success that I've had lately.

Despite the current corona crisis, I'm somehow in a better point financially than I have literally ever been in, and I know this for a fact because I keep records of most of my finances going back to when I turned 18, a to-do list which I started last year and a monthly budget chart on my computer that I add data to frequently. For context, I'm 26, have always been poor with money because no one ever taught me how to handle it properly, have been homeless and living out of a car on a handful of occasions, don't have a college degree (but am finally in school at 24 after waiting 6 years and doing odd jobs), and the last point I had this much money was in summer 2014, when I was working two jobs at seven days a week and saving as much as I could. Back then, I managed to save about $5,500, which isn't much, but it was enough for what I needed at the time. After that came a long period when I had bad luck, made a bunch of dumb decisions, had some poor choices thrown in and thrown at me by others, and effectively hit rock bottom. It hit a peak in early 2018 when I moved in with family for a second time, when I realized I had to get my shit together.

Fast forward to now and I'm in my second year of college, have my best-paying job to date with job security and transferability, and have an apartment of my own which I rent with a friend. This is my to-do list from last summer as of today:

1. Budget out rent, insurance, groceries, utilities and fuel at beginning of each month. (Approx. $800 in bills/mo; built 6 months' worth or more) \[DONE\]
2. Build primary checking and savings accounts back up to $1,000 minimum \[DONE\]
3. Balance other bank accounts with $1,000 minimum \[DONE\]
4. Buy cheap new phone plan (\~$30/mo) \[DONE\]
5. Buy used car w/insurance and registration (\~$1,500) \[DONE\]
6. Buy new bed, bedsheets, desk, chair and lamp (\~$300) \[DONE\]
7. Pay off medical bill 1 (\~$400) \[DONE\]
8. Pay off student loan interest \[DONE\]
9. Start paying off student loan principle \[Working on\]
10. Pay off medical bill 2 and outstanding balances elsewhere \[Working on\]

After paying about $560 in various bills just today, and after having gotten my tax returns deposited with the stimulus check, my most recent paycheck, and having all my accounts balanced, I currently have exactly $5,700. This beats my 2014 record by a mere $200, but hey, I'll take it! This was all done without credit cards, with only medical debt and school debt, without unemployment from the corona quarantine (my state office never got back to me despite multiple attempts), and while working either part-time or full-time depending on the semester, and going to school full time at 12 credits minimum. Took over two years since hitting rock bottom, and here I am.

,povertyfinance,"We moved to the midwest for cheaper housing and crappy winters. Wait, no, actually, just for cheaper housing. We're ready to buy a place now. Out here OK houses in OK neighborhoods are thirty grand -- or about 300/month all included. (Central Illinois, more or less.) That is basically our budget.

Income-wise, I pull in 17,000 a year, which won't go up. We get medicaid and that pays for all medical and prescription, which is huge because we both have expensive prescriptions. We also get SNAP. We don't live in luxury but we got what we need and are happy.

The kids want us living closer to them -- as close as reasonably possible. They live in San Diego. So, we're looking at California along its Eastern border, Nevada up to Reno, and out as far as Albuquerque in New Mexico. We purposely excluded Arizona. 

TLDR; We're looking for someplace fairly cheap to live, Eastern part of California, South half of Nevada or Western half of New Mexico. The closer we can come to living in a decent area at a really low house payment the better. As far as the house cost and payment amount is concerned, the kids are willing to help. My preference is to not get help from the kids, but if that's all we can do then it is what it is.

He not only hurt me physically (broken collarbone, damaged my eye so badly I needed 2 surgeries and now wear glasses, the list goes on...) but he hurt me mentally more than anything. Because of this, Family Court wanted to help me in any way that they can, so they helped me get into the domestic violence shelter. The shelter is right downtown where I had several appointments, meetings, and groups like the domestic violence survivors group, every day. This was working out fine until I reached my 3 month limit at the safe house/shelter. This was just as the coronavirus was becoming a problem. I have been able to stay with friends and my boyfriend for a few nights here and there, but I still have no permanent home. Family Court is shut down right now so the people who could help me find housing are unavailable to help me right now. My daughter is staying with my mom right now and she won’t allow me to stay at her house, I can’t even visit because she is so worried about the coronavirus. 

I became homeless at the direction of my Family Court caseworker. I was renting a room at my friend’s house and I was starting a new job right nearby at Burger King as a shift manager. Life was good. Then one day I received a call from my caseworker. She told me that I was due in Family Court the next day and if I didn’t appear I would have a warrant issued for my arrest!! Her solution was to pack a suitcase and come downtown. She also explained the guidelines for court and I was not allowed to work. She told me not to worry because the government would pay me temporary assistance money (welfare). I went through everything that I was required to do and ended up in the shelter that night. I had to wait over a month to get my public assistance and it ended up being 2 $25 payments a month. $50 a month to live on is incredibly difficult. My cell phone is off because I can’t afford a phone card, I have nothing to drink, not even water, because I needed to buy dog food. My children and my dog come first! My dog needs a new flea and tick collar and I have no idea how I’m going to come up with the $58 for it. Poor Lily dog had a big fat tick in her neck yesterday): I haven’t received a stimulus check, but I sure hope I get one! I’m just ranting because I’m disappointed in the entire court system and how screwed up things are there. I’m praying to God for a blessing!

Family Court is shut down right now so the people who could help me find housing are unavailable to help me right now. My daughter is staying with my mom right now and she won’t allow me to stay at her house, I can’t even visit because she is so worried about the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became homeless at the direction of my Family Court caseworker. I was renting a room at my friend’s house and I was starting a new job right nearby at Burger King as a shift manager. Life was good. Then one day I received a call from my caseworker. She told me that I was due in Family Court the next day and if I didn’t appear I would have a warrant issued for my arrest!! Her solution was to pack a suitcase and come downtown. She also explained the guidelines for court and I was not allowed to work. She told me not to worry because the government would pay me temporary assistance money (welfare). I went through everything that I was required to do and ended up in the shelter that night. I had to wait over a month to get my public assistance and it ended up being 2 $25 payments a month. $50 a month to live on is incredibly difficult. My cell phone is off because I can’t afford a phone card, I have nothing to drink, not even water, because I needed to buy dog food. My children and my dog come first! My dog needs a new flea and tick collar and I have no idea how I’m going to come up with the $58 for it. Poor Lily dog had a big fat tick in her neck yesterday): I haven’t received a stimulus check, but I sure hope I get one! I’m just ranting because I’m disappointed in the entire court system and how screwed up things are there. I’m praying to God for a blessing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Lily doesn’t stay with me as I struggle to find housing, she is safe and sound at home with Daddy (my boyfriend), she is our love child! I am just letting you know that she is doing great and I’m sure I will be able to find a way to get her the collar, so don’t worry about her (:&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"So, I'm not sure if this is an appropriate sub to post my story. By all means, remove it if I'm breaking a rule. I'm not a huge reddit person, so if anyone knows any other subs where this story would belong, please let me know. This story takes place in the USA.

I want to start off by saying that my story isn't particularly exceptional. There are absolutely people out there who have come into far more money and wasted it all. I have had people tell me that it'd be more surprising if I *hadn't* messed up as I did, due to my age and utter lack of guidance or foresight. But I'm not here to spout excuses, nor am I looking for judgment or any ""You should have used it xxx way instead."" This happened 6 years ago - it's far too late. I certainly do wish I had come to a place like this for advice back in the day, though. I am posting this to share my experiences - either for entertainment purposes, eye-opening information, or as a warning to others who come into any sizeable amount of money.

Let me be the perfect example of everything you DO NOT DO with a large amount of money. It has taken years for me to build up the courage to sign back into my old bank account and look at this information and these numbers. I literally could not bring myself to do it for a very long time. The first time I tried, I had to turn the screen off almost immediately. And that was 5 years after it was all over. I have spent a long time just trying to forget and pretend this never happened - even going so far as to omit this part of my story entirely when I share my life experiences with others. But, I am trying very hard to face myself and my problems lately, and this is part of it. I can honestly say that these mistakes have absolutely *fucked* up my entire life and taken my only chance away from me to gain a proper foothold in society and be on the same level as anyone else who was able to go to college and get a properly paying job. Now, my situation itself is fairly rare. But, I think universal lessons can be taken away from this. Hell, regardless of any of that, maybe this will simply entertain a few people at how fucking *stupidly* easy it is to waste this much money.

I won't get too much into my life story, because it's very long and complicated. But basically, I had slightly older middle-class white parents with good jobs. They both had type-2 diabetes and didn't manage it. So, they both passed away at different times once I turned 18 and had just finished high school. The rest of my family didn't give a shit about me after that, instead my half-siblings and my dad's new girlfriend (parents had divorced 2 years before dying) just vultured and stole away 1/3 of my dad's life insurance money that really should have went to me, because they were all financially stable and didn't need it, whereas I literally had nowhere to go and couldn't get any help since I was already 18. If there was anywhere I could go for help, I sure as hell didn't know about it since I grew up without needing social assistance or anything like that.

But in any case, my 1/4 portion of my dad's life insurance was $116,000. (Mom's was just 10 grand and I wouldn't get it until 1 year later and it was also wasted in the same way so I won't elaborate on that part) If anyone is curious about how it was so high, he was an airplane mechanic at a major international airport in Houston. He had life insurance through his job through MetLife.

I continued living in his house until I got the eviction notice. (It wasn't paid for and I couldn't afford the payments on it.) Then I just ran around like a chicken with its head cut off, staying at hotels at a weekly rate (the one thing I did right - use weekly rates if you need to stay for a prolonged period of time!!) and ordering pizza every night because I didn't have a stove to cook on and was too much of an idiot to just buy bread and microwaveable food or something.

You'll find a lot of that in this information I'm going to share - I was just a fucking idiot. I was 18 years old (turned 19 soon after getting the money) and I grew up in Texas where we have a garbage educational system even compared to other states. My parents never taught me anything about financing since they had so much damn money every paycheck that they never had to worry about saving or investing properly. I literally had no idea what to do and didn't even think of even asking online for advice, much less going to see a financial advisor. I didn't know they existed!

Now, I will let my bank account speak the rest for itself. The following is a video of me scrolling down my transactions on my bank's website. This account has been closed for years now, so I see no danger of anyone causing any harm. It's not like the account numbers are shown in full or anything. And yes, I used Hypercam to record because OBS wasn't working. :') It's a pretty long video, so it's probably easier to fast-forward it a bit. I open a text document and briefly explain some major purchases.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e52uLIr\_A2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e52uLIr_A2I)

The Too Long Didn't Watch version is:

The $116,00 was deposited on November 19, 2013. By June 30, 2014 it was gone.

\- $33,000: old house in the slums of Toledo, OH that I did not realize was in the slums because I did not research the area beforehand and even ignored a warning from my real-estate agent's husband about the area because 19 yo me was an idiot. **I lost $25,000 here** because I only was able to sell it back for **$8,000** due to vandals.

\- $17,000: Two different overpriced used cars bought from dealerships that together did not last me beyond mid-2016.

\- $5,000: Paying for the repairs of my car by myself after I swerved due to ice on the highway and crashed it. Did not know that auto insurance pays for repairs even if it's your fault. \*facepalms\*

\- $2,600 on an Alienware PC that stopped worked after 3 months because I accidentally spilled water on it and thus was not covered under the warranty.

\- Thousands on a big TV, furniture, and appliances that ended up getting left behind at the Toledo house because I didn't have enough money to move it to the next place I went to live at with my partner after fleeing the Toledo slums.

And the rest? Eating out/food delivery every day due to being too afraid to drive after the wreck and witnessing people driving like maniacs every time I went out on the roads in Toledo, ordering lots of anime figures and various goods of that nature, tons on digital entertainment like Second Life money, cosmetic items on mmorpgs, and currency for mobile games that I no longer play.

Combine all of this with earning no income from any sort of job, and that shit just drained riiiight on out.

It is now April 2020. I will spare the details of my personal situation and everything that had happened personally over all these years, but I have ended up homeless multiple times. I have type-2 diabetes that was diagnosed *before* my parents passed away, and all of that eating out has permanently ravaged my health and progressed the disease to the point where I now feel very lethargic from simply eating a few slices of bread. I have also been unable to afford health insurance to pay for medicine for years. And now that I finally moved somewhere (Michigan) that has a way for the poor to get health insurance, this corona shit just exploded and I can't go see a doctor to get any medicine because the bus system won't take anyone anywhere for a non-essential medical trip. If I wasn't working part-time at a grocery store right now, I'd be fucked and homeless. Again.

All that stuff I bought with the money? Yeah, I don't have any of it anymore. The ONLY thing I still have is the $2,000 Alienware laptop that I bought alongside the PC. It runs like shit now since it's been 6 years, and it probably will stop working at any moment. Being forced to move around a ton and ending up homeless caused me to lose everything else I had. (Which wasn't even that much - most of the money had went to eating out and making big dumb purchases that didn't last) I'll add that my mental state was actual garbage throughout all of this as well. I have often felt as though I'm living in a post-apocalyptic alternate reality that was caused by my mistakes. It has taken this long to feel comfortable looking at this bank information. I still wince. I have to laugh at myself to keep from plunging back into the sea of regret and despair. I've floated in that sea from the moment I started wasting that money.

And there that's my story. I saw my $1,200 stimulus deposit two days ago and just laughed at it. I'm going to pretend it doesn't even exist. I fucking *know better*. I walked through the fires of Hell to learn not to waste money, heck if I'm going to repeat the past even on a small amount.

If anyone would like me to send them my account statements (they're in formats unfamiliar to me like .ofx, .qbo, and .csv) in order to make any sort of compilation of data or even to study out of curiosity, just send me an e-mail. (I've got reddit messages turned off) You can find it in the About tab of my Youtube channel.

I literally could not bring myself to do it for a very long time. The first time I tried, I had to turn the screen off almost immediately. And that was 5 years after it was all over. I have spent a long time just trying to forget and pretend this never happened - even going so far as to omit this part of my story entirely when I share my life experiences with others. But, I am trying very hard to face myself and my problems lately, and this is part of it. I can honestly say that these mistakes have absolutely &lt;em&gt;fucked&lt;/em&gt; up my entire life and taken my only chance away from me to gain a proper foothold in society and be on the same level as anyone else who was able to go to college and get a properly paying job. Now, my situation itself is fairly rare. But, I think universal lessons can be taken away from this. Hell, regardless of any of that, maybe this will simply entertain a few people at how fucking &lt;em&gt;stupidly&lt;/em&gt; easy it is to waste this much money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t get too much into my life story, because it&amp;#39;s very long and complicated. But basically, I had slightly older middle-class white parents with good jobs. They both had type-2 diabetes and didn&amp;#39;t manage it. So, they both passed away at different times once I turned 18 and had just finished high school. The rest of my family didn&amp;#39;t give a shit about me after that, instead my half-siblings and my dad&amp;#39;s new girlfriend (parents had divorced 2 years before dying) just vultured and stole away 1/3 of my dad&amp;#39;s life insurance money that really should have went to me, because they were all financially stable and didn&amp;#39;t need it, whereas I literally had nowhere to go and couldn&amp;#39;t get any help since I was already 18. If there was anywhere I could go for help, I sure as hell didn&amp;#39;t know about it since I grew up without needing social assistance or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in any case, my 1/4 portion of my dad&amp;#39;s life insurance was $116,000. (Mom&amp;#39;s was just 10 grand and I wouldn&amp;#39;t get it until 1 year later and it was also wasted in the same way so I won&amp;#39;t elaborate on that part) If anyone is curious about how it was so high, he was an airplane mechanic at a major international airport in Houston. He had life insurance through his job through MetLife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued living in his house until I got the eviction notice. (It wasn&amp;#39;t paid for and I couldn&amp;#39;t afford the payments on it.) Then I just ran around like a chicken with its head cut off, staying at hotels at a weekly rate (the one thing I did right - use weekly rates if you need to stay for a prolonged period of time!!) and ordering pizza every night because I didn&amp;#39;t have a stove to cook on and was too much of an idiot to just buy bread and microwaveable food or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find a lot of that in this information I&amp;#39;m going to share - I was just a fucking idiot. I was 18 years old (turned 19 soon after getting the money) and I grew up in Texas where we have a garbage educational system even compared to other states. My parents never taught me anything about financing since they had so much damn money every paycheck that they never had to worry about saving or investing properly. I literally had no idea what to do and didn&amp;#39;t even think of even asking online for advice, much less going to see a financial advisor. I didn&amp;#39;t know they existed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I will let my bank account speak the rest for itself. The following is a video of me scrolling down my transactions on my bank&amp;#39;s website. This account has been closed for years now, so I see no danger of anyone causing any harm. It&amp;#39;s not like the account numbers are shown in full or anything. And yes, I used Hypercam to record because OBS wasn&amp;#39;t working. :&amp;#39;) It&amp;#39;s a pretty long video, so it&amp;#39;s probably easier to fast-forward it a bit. I open a text document and briefly explain some major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e52uLIr_A2I""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e52uLIr_A2I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Too Long Didn&amp;#39;t Watch version is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $116,00 was deposited on November 19, 2013. By June 30, 2014 it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- $33,000: old house in the slums of Toledo, OH that I did not realize was in the slums because I did not research the area beforehand and even ignored a warning from my real-estate agent&amp;#39;s husband about the area because 19 yo me was an idiot. &lt;strong&gt;I lost $25,000 here&lt;/strong&gt; because I only was able to sell it back for &lt;strong&gt;$8,000&lt;/strong&gt; due to vandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- $17,000: Two different overpriced used cars bought from dealerships that together did not last me beyond mid-2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- $5,000: Paying for the repairs of my car by myself after I swerved due to ice on the highway and crashed it. Did not know that auto insurance pays for repairs even if it&amp;#39;s your fault. *facepalms*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- $2,600 on an Alienware PC that stopped worked after 3 months because I accidentally spilled water on it and thus was not covered under the warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Thousands on a big TV, furniture, and appliances that ended up getting left behind at the Toledo house because I didn&amp;#39;t have enough money to move it to the next place I went to live at with my partner after fleeing the Toledo slums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the rest? Eating out/food delivery every day due to being too afraid to drive after the wreck and witnessing people driving like maniacs every time I went out on the roads in Toledo, ordering lots of anime figures and various goods of that nature, tons on digital entertainment like Second Life money, cosmetic items on mmorpgs, and currency for mobile games that I no longer play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine all of this with earning no income from any sort of job, and that shit just drained riiiight on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now April 2020. I will spare the details of my personal situation and everything that had happened personally over all these years, but I have ended up homeless multiple times. I have type-2 diabetes that was diagnosed &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; my parents passed away, and all of that eating out has permanently ravaged my health and progressed the disease to the point where I now feel very lethargic from simply eating a few slices of bread. I have also been unable to afford health insurance to pay for medicine for years. And now that I finally moved somewhere (Michigan) that has a way for the poor to get health insurance, this corona shit just exploded and I can&amp;#39;t go see a doctor to get any medicine because the bus system won&amp;#39;t take anyone anywhere for a non-essential medical trip. If I wasn&amp;#39;t working part-time at a grocery store right now, I&amp;#39;d be fucked and homeless. Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that stuff I bought with the money? Yeah, I don&amp;#39;t have any of it anymore. The ONLY thing I still have is the $2,000 Alienware laptop that I bought alongside the PC. It runs like shit now since it&amp;#39;s been 6 years, and it probably will stop working at any moment. Being forced to move around a ton and ending up homeless caused me to lose everything else I had. (Which wasn&amp;#39;t even that much - most of the money had went to eating out and making big dumb purchases that didn&amp;#39;t last) I&amp;#39;ll add that my mental state was actual garbage throughout all of this as well. I have often felt as though I&amp;#39;m living in a post-apocalyptic alternate reality that was caused by my mistakes. It has taken this long to feel comfortable looking at this bank information. I still wince. I have to laugh at myself to keep from plunging back into the sea of regret and despair. I&amp;#39;ve floated in that sea from the moment I started wasting that money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there that&amp;#39;s my story. I saw my $1,200 stimulus deposit two days ago and just laughed at it. I&amp;#39;m going to pretend it doesn&amp;#39;t even exist. I fucking &lt;em&gt;know better&lt;/em&gt;. I walked through the fires of Hell to learn not to waste money, heck if I&amp;#39;m going to repeat the past even on a small amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone would like me to send them my account statements (they&amp;#39;re in formats unfamiliar to me like .ofx, .qbo, and .csv) in order to make any sort of compilation of data or even to study out of curiosity, just send me an e-mail. (I&amp;#39;ve got reddit messages turned off) You can find it in the About tab of my Youtube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time. I am happy to share my experiences, no matter how idiotic and full of shitty mistakes, if it can help anyone at all, or even make a single person laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"This is a question about unemployment for my 16 year old daughter.

A little back ground first. 

The family for all intents is myself, and 2 children, a 12 year old and a 16 year old. Mom passed away in 2017. We were neither married nor together and i have always had custody. I had a judgment, but mom was noncollectable for child support. Since she has passed, the children both receive social security benefits and I am the designated payee. i use 1 kids payment to pay about 1/3 of our house payment and the others goes directly to a 529 account split in their names. 

I am an electrician and have remained employed through all of this I make appx. 70k per year. That is only my w2 income and about all that is on my tax return. I list both children as dependents, and do not list them as having any income, as the social security, I believe does not need to be included if it is their only income. (Am i right on that?)

Anyway, this year my 16 year old got a job. she worked from January till March, then sporadically until this week. Her boss let her know he was closing shop and continuing business at his other location (small pizza franchise with 3 units for this one owner, well 2 now). He offered her a job there, but it is 2 towns over and she doesn't really want to deal with the hassle. She was making 9.25 per hour and was working around 25 hours per week and much less the last month. 

Heres the big question. Is this an unemployment eligible event? Can she qualify for the CARES act additional unemployment? What are the tax implications for filing next year? Will she need to file as single since she has a w2 and a possible 1099 from unemployment? Can she still be my dependent and I claim her? I do support her and I do get a child tax credit for each of them, which makes the refund a bit nicer and I'd hate to lose that. I just want her to get all the possible benefits she can, at the same time, I dont want to lose any of the tax benefits later. Pulling in an unanticipated 2000 bucks a month could really jump start her. She has about 1200 in savings and could have a enough for a very reliable car by the end of summer.

WE are in Missouri, by the way. So what are the thoughts?

,povertyfinance,"It has become highly evident to me, as time rolls on, that the current banking system in the United States is completely and totally without coincidence, designed to keep people as poor as long as possible.

It is high time we stop using the outdated ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" and ""it's your fault that you are poor"" bullshit. This is a division tactic and how many people were honestly told this during the great depression as people killed themselves due to poverty and bankers leapt off the tops of buildings? Honestly? Probably very few. 

It has become increasingly harder since the 1970's to make a living for yourself. 

This is not your fault. You have factors within your control, and many factors that are outside of your control. During a depression, it is simply harder to make a living, or even make any money at all. There are many, many things that have a direct impact on your future. Even your parents play a role. People who are born into extreme wealth will have a much easier time to maintain their own wealth because their parents will usually do things like buy them a car, pay for their college, and of course leave them a tidy some of money when they pass. Some people are born into such wealth, they don't have to work a single day in their life. 

But, focusing on right now, more and more people have to put their future in the hands of the banks through debt.

It should be glaringly obvious that the more people who are ""well off"" or middle class, the less money they have to borrow. The banks honestly hate this. The more people they can keep poor, the more money they will make, especially at a time when borrowing rates are low. 

If more people are well-off, and rates are high, they have no trouble lending money at rates that are two to three times as high as they are now. But with historically low rates, the banks have to find a way to make money. 

Lets look at the most glaring feature of this, the overdraft fee. Even if you overdraft your bank by $10, the bank comes along and tacks on a fee, usually $35. 

So now, not only are you poorer, you now have to come up with $45 instead of $10. While the personal finance circle jerkers would love to smear you and say it's your fault, many millions of people are poor in the US and live paycheck to paycheck. They may simply have no other means to avoid an overdraft. Their paycheck might be $600 but they have $610 worth of critical expenses including rent, food, electric, etc.

Anyone who sees the overdraft fee as an honest fee, is in my opinion, criminally insane and morally bankrupt. People are charged $35 for being short $10. Banks run out of money all the time, and are allowed to borrow through the intrerbank system at **less than 1%**.

There is no valid excuse to charge people almost $40 for simply being poor. The overdraft fee came out at a time when the middle class was at a much higher percentage than it is today. It was simply a fee for not balancing your checkbook better, and many people never needed to worry about said fee. The fee for overdraft during the 80's used to be about $10, but banks soon kept charging higher and higher fees when they realized they could make a killing as a extremely high priced short-term borrowing ""service"". 

Banks make somewhere around **$30B a year** in overdraft fees. This is about $90 collected from every man, woman and child every single year. 

But moving on from this, and as I said earlier, the poorer the average person is, the more money the banks can make.

There was a time in America when you didn't need a degree to make good money. While many blame the exodus of ""good paying American jobs"" on President Clinton, it actually started much earlier than that. I buy and sell a lot of stuff on eBay, and find quite a bit of goods including consumer electronics that were made in China or Japan during the 80s and even late 70's. While there were a lot of jobs lost to other countries during NAFTA, this practice had been going on for well over a decade.

Anyway, it is very hard to make decent money without a college degree anymore thanks to this. I've talked to many older people in my family who were making the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $20-$25 per hour during the 60's 70's and 80's working at a factory, out of high school and of course with no college degree. 

If they wanted to go to college, it was entirely possible to work part-time during the summer and pay for an entire year of college, without loans, federal grants, etc.

But banks soon realized if people can do this, they can do so without borrowing. My dad bought a brand new car with his factory job in 1970, and paid cash. He bought a home to rent out as well, and paid for it in cash. Try doing that today at a factory. Oh..did I mention most factories actually pay less now than they did 30 years ago, accounting for inflation? My father made $16/hr in the year 1999 before he retired. That is $24.79 today, and the same factory is surprisingly still open. They start people out at $14 an hour. Go figure.

So very soon, college degrees became barriers of entry into good paying jobs. A lot of jobs that didn't even require degrees before soon did. A lot of jobs that required associate degrees 20 years ago now require a bachelors, and for the bachelor graduates of 20 years ago, more jobs require master degrees. 

Of course, the longer you stay in college, the more money they can make off you, and the cost of attendance rises quite a bit **EVERY YEAR**, despite wages **barely** increasing with inflation over a 20 year time span. 

Now people are graduating and possibly getting a good paying job, but not everyone does. There simply aren't enough to go around. Av average job can sometimes see almost 200 applications. 

People love to brag that only 4% of college graduates are unemployed. This is true, but the real figure is close to **41% of college graduates are currently working in a job** ***that does not require*** **a degree.** 

So while 96% of college grads are in fact working, nearly 45% of them are working in a dead end job. You can go to Walmart or McDonalds and see many people working there that have bachelors degrees.

This is because they were sold a lie. A lie of ""if you go to college, you will get a good paying job"". This lie is a trap, a trap to keep people in upwards of $100,000 in debt. 

The next biggest thing you will purchase is a house, which is now much harder to purchase than your parents or grandparents bought one for.

The median home price in 1970 was only $17,000. $113,091 in today's money.

The median home price today is $248,857, 2.2 times the cost of a home in 1970.

Now, not only does it cost a recent college grad a lot more to buy a house, their $500-$600 a month student loan payments are factored into their debt to income ratio, which can mean a higher borrowing rate, or a longer term, thus trapping people for even longer. When you factor in the double cost of buying a home today, trying to do so on 15 year terms is nearly impossible, so now banks are pushing for more and more 30 year mortgages.

Using the median home price of today, you will have paid a bank over $100,000 more in interest than picking a 15 year term.

But as I said earlier, some factors are in your control, some are not. You obviously have no control over why the median price of a home has doubled and then some since 1970. You have no control over the price of college going up more and more every year. 

The home of today is much larger than the home of 1970. According to the US census, the average home in 1973 was 1660 square feet. Today it's 2679 square feet. 

Which makes no sense, unless of course you are the bank. The bank fronts money to the construction company that builds a new home. Bigger home, more interest. Then of course the same trick when you buy the home. More interest, less chance of affording a 15 year term.

It also makes no sense that the home of today is 1000 square feet larger than a home in 1973. The average family size is smaller, there are more single parent families and people are having fewer children. 

Now I'm going to stop here, as I could go on for pages on end. But my main point is this: anyone who uses the ""your fault your poor"" is full of shit. They are brainwashed and the banks and other lending institutions in this country LOVE IT when people spout this BS.

It absolves them (the banks) of all fault. It pushes the problem away from the real problem and gaslights it onto other people. 

You have a small amount of control on your finances, the economy and the banks have a much larger bearing on your financial success than you will EVER realize.   
The thumb-grip of the bank tightens every year. If you told people in the 70's there were vacation and wedding loans, they would laugh at you at such an idea. But they are very true today.

Should we be punished for trying to maintain the same standard of living your parents or grand parents had in the 70s? Should we all just continue to live farther and farther below our means because achieving their standard of living today is nearly impossible without going into debt?

If you answered ""yes"", then congrats, you are one of the few people right now who understand just what the hell is going on. If not, then congrats, the banks have successfully brainwashed you into repeating ""its your fault your poor"".",t2_33sqykx9,False,,0,False,A nation of debt.

I&amp;#39;ve talked to many older people in my family who were making the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $20-$25 per hour during the 60&amp;#39;s 70&amp;#39;s and 80&amp;#39;s working at a factory, out of high school and of course with no college degree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they wanted to go to college, it was entirely possible to work part-time during the summer and pay for an entire year of college, without loans, federal grants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But banks soon realized if people can do this, they can do so without borrowing. My dad bought a brand new car with his factory job in 1970, and paid cash. He bought a home to rent out as well, and paid for it in cash. Try doing that today at a factory. Oh..did I mention most factories actually pay less now than they did 30 years ago, accounting for inflation? My father made $16/hr in the year 1999 before he retired. That is $24.79 today, and the same factory is surprisingly still open. They start people out at $14 an hour. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So very soon, college degrees became barriers of entry into good paying jobs. A lot of jobs that didn&amp;#39;t even require degrees before soon did. A lot of jobs that required associate degrees 20 years ago now require a bachelors, and for the bachelor graduates of 20 years ago, more jobs require master degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the longer you stay in college, the more money they can make off you, and the cost of attendance rises quite a bit &lt;strong&gt;EVERY YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;, despite wages &lt;strong&gt;barely&lt;/strong&gt; increasing with inflation over a 20 year time span. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now people are graduating and possibly getting a good paying job, but not everyone does. There simply aren&amp;#39;t enough to go around. Av average job can sometimes see almost 200 applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People love to brag that only 4% of college graduates are unemployed. This is true, but the real figure is close to &lt;strong&gt;41% of college graduates are currently working in a job&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;that does not require&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;a degree.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while 96% of college grads are in fact working, nearly 45% of them are working in a dead end job. You can go to Walmart or McDonalds and see many people working there that have bachelors degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because they were sold a lie. A lie of &amp;quot;if you go to college, you will get a good paying job&amp;quot;. This lie is a trap, a trap to keep people in upwards of $100,000 in debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next biggest thing you will purchase is a house, which is now much harder to purchase than your parents or grandparents bought one for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median home price in 1970 was only $17,000. $113,091 in today&amp;#39;s money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median home price today is $248,857, 2.2 times the cost of a home in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, not only does it cost a recent college grad a lot more to buy a house, their $500-$600 a month student loan payments are factored into their debt to income ratio, which can mean a higher borrowing rate, or a longer term, thus trapping people for even longer. When you factor in the double cost of buying a home today, trying to do so on 15 year terms is nearly impossible, so now banks are pushing for more and more 30 year mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the median home price of today, you will have paid a bank over $100,000 more in interest than picking a 15 year term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I said earlier, some factors are in your control, some are not. You obviously have no control over why the median price of a home has doubled and then some since 1970. You have no control over the price of college going up more and more every year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home of today is much larger than the home of 1970. According to the US census, the average home in 1973 was 1660 square feet. Today it&amp;#39;s 2679 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes no sense, unless of course you are the bank. The bank fronts money to the construction company that builds a new home. Bigger home, more interest. Then of course the same trick when you buy the home. More interest, less chance of affording a 15 year term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes no sense that the home of today is 1000 square feet larger than a home in 1973. The average family size is smaller, there are more single parent families and people are having fewer children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m going to stop here, as I could go on for pages on end. But my main point is this: anyone who uses the &amp;quot;your fault your poor&amp;quot; is full of shit. They are brainwashed and the banks and other lending institutions in this country LOVE IT when people spout this BS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It absolves them (the banks) of all fault. It pushes the problem away from the real problem and gaslights it onto other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a small amount of control on your finances, the economy and the banks have a much larger bearing on your financial success than you will EVER realize.&lt;br/&gt;
The thumb-grip of the bank tightens every year. If you told people in the 70&amp;#39;s there were vacation and wedding loans, they would laugh at you at such an idea. But they are very true today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we be punished for trying to maintain the same standard of living your parents or grand parents had in the 70s? Should we all just continue to live farther and farther below our means because achieving their standard of living today is nearly impossible without going into debt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you answered &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, then congrats, you are one of the few people right now who understand just what the hell is going on. If not, then congrats, the banks have successfully brainwashed you into repeating &amp;quot;its your fault your poor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"I just turned 17 2 days ago. And now that I’m 17 I’m closer to becoming an “adult”. I really want to move out of my mom’s place. Seems stupid, as I haven’t fully matured in a sense. But I just can’t deal with the problems at home anymore, with my mom to my brother and so on. It’s an extremely unhealthy environment, so bad where I’ve had become extremely depressed and developed severe anxiety (I have a therapist to help now), I’ve also had to be hospitalized a week for suicidal tendencies and such.

Ok, she is 21 and this is her 1st pregnancy. She is not that far along (5-7 weeks) but her family does not approve of her baby daddy. I don't know if he will be a part of their life or not. This is not about all that, I want to help her plan, help her make the right decisions and know how to guide her towards what she needs.

So far, (she only found out 3 days ago that she is pregnant) she has until May 31 to move out of her house. I am pretty sure she wants to move out as soon as possible. She hasn't held a job in a while (her parents kind of spoiled her) and she doesn't have a car. She has two possible jobs lined up as in she has a friend who is manager or works there. She does not have a bank account or any credit cards. I have helped her find a place that has openings for her to rent and she has found someone that may be able to be her roommate and split the costs. it will be a two bedroom mobile home. She is supposed to go to the health dept. soon and get onto insurance and wic and food stamps. I know someone who had a newborn this past winter and she said she has lots of 0-3 month boy clothes that she will give me. Sadly, she literally gave away the newborn clothes last week.

It has been a while since I had my child so I don't remember a lot. I can't help her out financially much.

like, what is absolutely essential when moving out on your own for the first time? What does she need while she is pregnant? What things does she need once the baby is here, what is essential and what is not?

any help, advice, etc is much appreciated. This is such a hard situation. I want to be happy for her but also realistic. I don't want her to be completely hopeless.

,povertyfinance,"My Mother is 64 and last August she suffered a brain bleed which led to a stroke.  Within 3 months she made an astounding recovery.  No speech or physical deficiencies remain, however she now suffers from somewhat of a bad short term memory.  I recently spoke with her and she mentioned that her insurance she has (TN Farm Bureau) had stated that it was considered a pre-existing condition and is refusing to cover any of it.  I tried getting more information out of her but the short term memory problems means that many details get lost.  From what I can gather, her bills will reach close to 100k which she doesn't have.  She recently retired and is living off her 401k and I think social security.  She's talking about declaring bankruptcy but is worried they will take her 401k, her home etc.  Basically want to know if anything can be done with the insurance company, can she appeal a decision like that?  If she does declare bankruptcy can they take her 401k and home?  I've been trying to meet up with her so I can help her navigate some of this stuff but she has been living out in the boonies on a huge tract of land that her husband owns and they only come into town once every 3 or 4 weeks. They get no cell phone service out there except for one small spot on a hill where they live and the connection is spotty at best.  I've told her that hospitals have programs the will reduce or even eliminate your debt but you have to apply which I don't think she has.

Any help would be appreciated.  If this is the wrong subreddit I apologize and point me in the right direction.

  
Thank you

,povertyfinance,"This message is to everyone, but I was inspired to ask this after seeing the post by a user who talked about losing their job today - so I hope this isn’t against the guidelines.

I started a talk show (web series) and want to have everyone willing on, as my guest. Share with others how this pandemic has affected your life and the lives of those in your community. Share your perspective with me, and the world. 

About Me: I’m an American Iraq War veteran, small business owner, home owner, landlord to roommates and an MBA. I didn’t come from money and worked my face off to get where I’m at -  but I’m not done until I bring a ton of people with me. My mission isn’t solely about money. My mission is mental health and well-being for all humans through knowledge sharing and discourse. Wages are important, but what we do with our wages and what we petition from our government are matters I find most important. So let’s share and discuss those things so we can get closer to an answer that works for everyone. 

Purpose: This project is my way of trying to give back to the world through conversation and knowledge sharing.

When/How: The show is broadcast live every Saturday afternoon and the idea would be to have you Skype in and share your story. I’ll ask a few follow up questions and the convo rolls from there. I’ve been averaging 10-20 mins with each person I’ve talked to thus far.

Name: The DA Perspective 

Contact: You can reach me via any message inbox where you find my content.. here, YT or FB. I’ll always answer.

Thanks everyone and I hope you’re all staying in as good of spirits as you can during these unusual and difficult times.

,povertyfinance,"A week or so ago I posted in the Pest Control subreddit that raccoons had been running night and day all over the (partially unfinished) attic. I was concerned, because not only were they very heavy and shaking the full ceiling across the house, but also because I did not have money to do shit about them, and no one was able to come thanks to Coronavirus.

Guess what happened this evening!!!

After less than 5 minutes of violent fighting in the attic, there was a massive crash from the bathroom upstairs. ONE had fallen through and was stuck in the bathroom. We closed the door, and called 911, and they transferred us to animal control. They came, removed it, and they let it free CLOSE TO THE HOUSE! Now it's probably going to come right back in!

The hole is still there, the remaining raccoons (including the babies!!!) are STILL in the attic and will probably start fighting again soon. The entrance is a hole in the damaged siding outside the screen porch - this is how they enter into the house, and into the attic.

I've called someone, and the earliest they can come is tomorrow morning - guess I'm staying up the entire night. They said they'd have to inspect full and access the situation - but I don't know how I'm going to find the money to pay them!!

I'm poor - I'm REALLY poor, and I have such little money!!! On top of that, while I have not been fired, my retail job is still closed due to the virus, and I have no work or salary, just unemployment.

But the hole - both in the bathroom, and in the siding - MUST be fixed! And the raccoons MUST get out.

What on earth do I do??? On top of everything else, it's going to rain heavily tomorrow - not only is this going to further damage the parts exposed by the hole(s), but whenever it rains, the raccoons ALWAYS come to the attic, and they ALWAYS fight.

I'm terrified they're going to make more holes, and fall on me and the other person in the house. The person I called said it's probably going to run into the THOUSANDS to get everything fixed and the raccoons gone.

I just. Fuck. FUCK.

Have been working casually for about 4 years and saved almost everything I have made. About 5K has been gifted to me from my parents for my 18th and 21st. I saved all of my birthday money when younger and also the $5 a week I was given as lunch money for school.

**Income**

\- last financial year $33,000

\- On $27.10 an hour and am on track to earn about the same this financial year.

**Expenses**

\-Phone credit and data $205 a year

\- Car rego and insurance $1500 a year

\- food $200ish a month

\- fuel about $30 a month

\- $50 a week in board (living in sydney with family friends as parents moved out of Sydney to blue mountains)

\- $100 every quarter for bills.

**Debt**

\- $15,000 in HECS debt. Loan from the government for university and have to start paying it back once i earn over $46,620.

I finish uni in November next year and should be able to save $500 min a week until then.

,povertyfinance,"I am a Prius driving Uber Eats and Cavier food delivery driver in Portland, OR. I am also a computer science student in university now. I was doing the math on how much it costs me to do a half of day of delivering. The cost of gasoline alone is about $2.99 for a gallon of gas that will get me 46 miles of range. Daily it's about six dollars for round numbers for gas per day. Insurance costs an additional $184/month for full coverage so that's about $6.04 for insurance per day. That makes driving the car after it's paid off over $9 per day for delivering. This isn't including the depreciation that the added milage is giving to the car weekly.

The battery in the bike has 800 cycles of charge on it so that will give 800 days of full charge which if we use the cost of replacing the entire bike after 800 days it is $1.25 per day for each ride. So just say I got two bikes initial cost $2,000. That's a cost of $2.50 per day opposed to $9.04 per day. That's a significant savings over the course of a month. 9.04\*30.5= $275.72, 2.50\*30=$76.25, $275.72-76.25= $199.47 of savings per month. That's two new bikes vs driving a 2010 Prius with a perfect driving record and full coverage insurance in Portland.

I've been watching review videos on Rad Power bikes. The reviewer that I'm watching I've been following for years and I respect his talk about both the ups and downs of the bikes. I'm watching the review of the RadRunner Power Bike. I really like how the RadRunner bike is set up. It comes with a central hub single speed 750 watt Dafang motor. The battery is a 28V 14AH Samsung. It is on sale right now for $1,200. Since I'm a student and delivery driver/rider I they are giving a generous $200 discount on their bikes right now. I'm looking at getting that bike with a few accessories like the center console, and large rear rack and large delivery bag.

Your thoughts on this bike for $1,000 for food delivery? Link to the bike here ---&gt; [https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrunner-electric-utility-bike?variant=20181528019040](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrunner-electric-utility-bike?variant=20181528019040)

More math, this bike more than pays for itself. If I invest in the stock market that $200 per month that I would save from driving to go to a bike here's what would happen. I would have $2,789 in my investment account after two years of investing $1,200 per year at a 9.8% rate of return adjusted 2% for inflation. So, in two years if I pulled the investments I would avoid the long term capital gains tax and have in theory another $389 to spend on the bike. For round numbers my next Rad Power bike would then be $611 with the discount I've given myself from investing in the stock market.  The my cost per day goes to $0.76 if I buy a new bike. If I buy a new battery when mine dies after 800 charges then it's even less to replace. The bike won't need replaced after 800 charge cycles, but the battery will.

,povertyfinance,"&gt;**(Washington, D.C., April 21, 2020)** – U.S. Secretary of  Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced approval of requests from  **Kentucky**, **Missouri**, and **Texas** to provide online purchasing of food to  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households.   
&gt;  
&gt;This  approval will allow the States to expedite the implementation of online  purchasing with currently authorized SNAP online retailers with a target  start date to be announced at a later time.   
&gt;  
&gt;Kentucky’s SNAP  participation is over 500,000 individuals, more than 225,000 households,  and totals nearly $750 million annually in federal funding.   
&gt;  
&gt;Missouri’s  SNAP participation is nearly 650,000 individuals, nearly 300,000  households, and totals nearly $1 billion annually in federal funding.  Texas’ SNAP participation is over 3.2 million individuals, more than 1.4  million households, and totals nearly $5 billion annually in federal  funding.

&gt;The [SNAP online pilot](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot)  is ***currently operational*** in **Alabama**, **Iowa**, **Nebraska**, **New York**, **Oregon**,  and **Washington State**.   
&gt;  
&gt;The authorized retailers working with all pilot  states are Amazon and Walmart, while Wrights Market and ShopRite are  working with Alabama and New York respectively.

,povertyfinance,"Last year I was struggling to survive on less than $200 a paycheck so in January I dropped my medical insurance to have a little extra money. Last month I lost one of my jobs the week before getting laid off at my other job due to quarantine. Due to this sub I had a budget and a little money set aside. I still haven't recieved unemployment money yet, and strangely, I'm fine. 
I got my stimulus money and paid off a bill I was worried about, and I watch my friends' kid while they work. (They are in healthcare, so are essential and I'm otherwise quarantined alone and therefore we are  in each other's ten people limit.) I'm getting ready to plant a food garden, and they give me gas money and will help me with food if I need it. I make masks for people I know and when I can't do that stuff I play video games or read or knit. 

With my prior savings and this stimulus check, I have almost $2000 to live on until my unemployment comes through. I don't have rent as I live in my brother's house as caretaker. It's almost 2 months behind for my unemployment. 

What feels wrong is I'm not worried. I'm not scared. I know I'm going to be alright and this year will end on a higher note than last year no matter what. I feel like I'm bragging, but it's not my intention. My mental health has never been better and I'm not going on crazy shopping binges.

 I'm more confused as to why I feel so wrong  and like a bad person because I'm not freaked out about this.

Okay, please be kind, I honestly don’t know a whole lot about investing in a future. 

I’ve lived in poverty my whole life, I’ve been asking adultier friends and my adult family members for advice, but no one in my family has ever had a credit card, or been responsible with one. 

I am 20 years old and based in Texas, looking to get a credit card through Wells Fargo, who I bank with. What kinds of steps should I take before applying? Does anyone have experience with Wells Fargo’s credit cards/which ones are the best for a first time applicant? My credit score is in the “good” range. I have a phone bill that I pay on time, and have since 2018. I’ve never missed a payment. I work at a restaurant and make about $9/hr + tips and work around 25 hours a week. I’m not looking to put any HUGE expenses on it, just maybe groceries when needed and small purchases. Is this a good plan when building credit? 

I live rent free for another 10 months, at which point my fiancé and I will be applying to rent a house with a friend. 

I can’t think of anymore relevant information but I can answer any clarifying questions.

Is this right? Is there anything else I can do to get my credit score up? It’s pretty pathetically dismal right now, my boyfriend cringed when he saw it...

2. Get a new credit card. When I realized I was spending out of control I let the card expire and didn’t try to renew it (actually, I don’t know that they would have let me?).

I'm going into a career in less than a years time where I will need a car, and have no other option. Currently I'm a university student with the full yearly loan to live on of £9250. I also have some savings that I can use when the time comes to it around the £2000 mark. I don't have money from parents, this will be off my own back

My plan is to buy a car around the £500-700 mark. I don't mind if it's old or weird, I like quirky things. Unfortunately I'm no contact with my Dad, he was the go-to car person and more or less knew what was a bad purchase. 

I have honestly no idea what to look for when buying a car. I know nothing about the finance of it, except that it costs a lot. I don't really know if that's a feasible budget, how much I should be putting away each month for running costs etc. Any advice? Any cost saving tips? Any car buying tips?

,povertyfinance,"This story is complicated and full of my fuck ups and life circumstances.  I don't think there's much universal advice besides 'save money if at all possible' but I want to give a detailed long term picture.

A little more than 11 years ago my husband and I got married.  I was managing a little grocery/check cashing place, and he was trying to find his way in the working world.  We were making something like 25k/year combined and just barely scraping by.  No savings.

I went to community college and state school and racked up 30k in debt.  I majored in psychology and couldn't face getting a masters and even more debt.  

His mother let us move in with her rent free.  It was an amazing stroke of good luck.  Ended up working in a restaurant making $7.50/hr.

I was a cigarette smoker, had a drinking problem, and smoked weed.  I was depressed and scared all the time about money and not having health insurance.  My husband eventually became a medical assistant and went to work at a local medical center.  The pay wasn't great but the benefits were.

I took the restaurant job very seriously.  It was at a place that's nationally known for good food and treating its workers well and there was a clearly defined training program with raises.  It was a tedious son of a bitch to jump through the hoops for $0.50/hour but I did.

For the first 3 years my paychecks were between $450-$600 every two weeks, and I just paid half to my student loans and lived off the rest.  I'd save up a bit here or there but ended up paying it to my loans or using it for something specific.

I quit drinking and used our health insurance to get therapy. 

My husband was diagnosed with ADHD.  He dropped to part time and only had enough to live on.  (He did save through payroll deductions for retirement.)

I got a raise to $13.25/hr, and a year later to $17.89/hr.  I kept living on $600/month, and paid off my debt.  I saved up for a car and later for an emergency fund.  I took advantage of payroll deductions for HSA and retirement.

My husband quit work to go back to welding school.  Without his income, moving out would mean a bare bones, paycheck to paycheck existence.

A friend from the restaurant found an office job and got me an interview.  I landed the job, and had a set schedule and holidays off for the first time in my life.  I got a few raises there, paid my car debt down to $2500, and saved the 10k emergency fund.

Before corona, my husband was set to graduate in August, and we were discussing whether to buy a house or build an addition and stay, when to have a kid (if I'm not too old at 34).

My story has privilege (family able to provide a place to live) and luck (ex-coworker getting me new job) as well has hard work (at the restaurant and my new job) and good spending/saving habits.  I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own.

,povertyfinance,"I am extremely worried right now and could really use some help. My weekly unemployment is $195 and I get paid $14/hr. When I certify for my weekly benefits it asks me for my gross income for the week. I worked 18 hours at a fast food restaurant making $252 gross earning and it made me not qualify for unemployment for that week. On the next week I earned about $179 gross earning.

My weekly unemployment is $195 and I get paid $14/hr. When I certify for my weekly benefits it asks me for my gross income for the week. I worked 18 hours at a fast food restaurant making $252 gross earning and it made me not qualify for unemployment for that week. On the next week I earned about $179 gross earning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my situation if I average working more then 12 hours a week I lose all my benefits and make around $600 a month after taxes. If I stay eligible for unemployment I make about $3,180 with unemployment and Cares act benefits. My employer gave us the option to not work if we are afraid to catch the Corona Virus but I don&amp;#39;t know if that would make me lose benefits if I voluntary choose not to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents were self employed selling ice cream from a food truck and we are working on trying to get them unemployment but in the meantime while they are struggling to qualify I am using my benefits to support them and helping my ex girlfriend who is a hair stylist however little I can while she figures out her unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"As opposed to a generic guide, here are the actual mindset and behavioural changes that I made in order to break the living paycheck to paycheck cycle. These may not be an option for some so I'll start with my circumstances 2 years ago: Mid 20s, no dependants, renting accommodation, earning £22k, in August 2018 I had 2k debt 0 assets and 0 cash. My circumstances have changed significantly since then and here is why: 

1. **I stopped (seriously curtailed) eating out and takeaways, including coffee.** This probably had the greatest effect of all changes. ^(£2k per year saved.) 
2. **I moved to a city where my rent would be less than 30% of my income.** Obviously I could have stayed in the city I was in and lived in a dump, but instead I moved to where I could live in decent conditions with &lt;30% of my income. ^(£2k per year saved.)
3. **I started using Revolut (or other app based bank).** This allowed me to see clearly what I was spending on eating out, which was embarrassing considering my circumstances. 
4. **I accepted renting accommodation as a positive.**  I previously thought that by renting my apartment, unable to purchase it, was putting me at a disadvantage in terms of generating wealth. But the more I look into the pros and cons of renting vs buying the more I see it the opposite way. I cannot stress how much realising this positively affected my outlook, I regret not realising it sooner. In accepting renting as a choice and not a circumstance it allowed me to begin financially planning for the future without any hangups. 
5. **I cleared my debt.** I didn't have much to begin with however it was a major weight lifted when I cleared the debt I had. Following on from the previous point regarding not getting a mortgage, one of my new goals is to remain debt free for my entire life. 
6. **I stopped getting hung up on politics.** I vote at every opportunity, and that's my part done. I figured unless I was going to become a full-time activist (which isn't a good financial decision), any time spent getting bothered about politics was a complete waste of my time and energy. 
7. **I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu:** This obviously costs money however it was a fixed cost and it meant I always had something to do, 7 nights a week if I wanted. This could as easily been cross-fit, a normal gym or running. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu had an odd side effect that I always had my clothes washed as I needed to clean my uniform several times a week and this helped with my general productivity. 
8. **I bought a bike.** A fairly cheap bike but one that worked correctly. £600 saved on public transport right away. 
9. **I stopped drinking:** This is a new addition for me, 4 months in, but I got to the stage that every time I went out I spent a lot of money, missed training the next day, and felt generally bad about it. I still go out and have a good time just without getting smashed or spending a fortune.

Any tips for keeping this expense down? 

Here are a few of my own tips- I buy second hand for nearly everything. I keep a minimal wardrobe, so I don't have to keep a lot on hand. 

I use arm and Hammer sensitive detergent, I think it's a good value, and doesn't make my skin mad. I don't use dryer sheets or liquid. I get out stains with oxiclean spray and an old toothbrush. 

I hang up bras and my work uniforms, to keep them looking nicer. I also hang leggings, really anything that could get beat up in a dryer.

,povertyfinance,"This might be a long story so heads up. I’m in my mid twenties and work in a minimum wage job. 

A few years ago I started buying stuff frivolously on a credit card, it wasn’t expensive stuff but it would add up quite quickly. I know red flag right away. I was becoming obsessed with having the latest thing and showing it off on social media I’m sure you know the score. I ended up running up a debt of over £2k and quickly couldn’t keep up and was just accumulating more interest. Eventually of a few months of keeping it bottled in it got to a point where I was struggling to sleep and constantly in a bad mood. In all honesty I wasn’t scared about myself, I was scared for my parents that I might be at work and one day bailiffs came to my house (I live with parents) and they have to foot the bill or take their property for my recklessness, and I wouldn’t want to put that burden or stress on my family. I think it would be worse that I felt I couldn’t ask for help and them disappointed that I couldn’t say I’m struggling.

One day I told my mum I needed to confess this stupid thing I done, she didn’t judge me and came up with a plan of action, but once I did it was like a weight lifted from my shoulders. She used a company to pay the debt off and I have a year to pay the entire amount money off with a £60 or something charge, and within a year I had this paid off and was completely out of debt.

However I recently had an epiphany or a crisis depending on how you look at it, I was looking at my life and while I’m not in debt anymore I haven’t got any savings put away and what would happen if I suddenly needed money for whatever reason. So with this I decided that I didn’t want to be broke at 35 living with parents, not having a pot to piss in but all of these material things so I started saving immediately.

I live quite a cheap and efficient life, I don’t drink, never smoke or do drugs and don’t gamble. So saving shouldn’t be hard once I got into a consistent routine, I decided that if I could put away £400 a month that would be just under £5k a year, and if I could do that for 3 years then it’s enough for a deposit on a house. 

6 months later, I have saved over my goal for the year. already and am doing really well. The £400 a month is a minimum amount I’m trying to save and if I can afford more one month then I will put more away, and suddenly the future looks bright and I’m excited by saving and planning for the future.

For anyone who’s struggling reach out to someone family or a support group and it does get better. I never thought I would be able to save like this but with the right support, getting my head in the right mindset, deleting social media and planning a future that I have got my life back on track and to something I am proud of.

,povertyfinance,"I have a 4k balance on a card and I used my stimulus check to pay 1k off, so in a few days my new balance will be 3k.

I need advice on how I should be spending my money, given that I dont know when my job will fully reopen and feel like I should have some cushion as well as pay down the rest of the 3k. Here's my breakdown:

UI wages: $140/week

Cares act boost: $580/week, will last until at least May 16th (after that, depends on what the state governor says)

Wages: $250 every two weeks because my hours have been reduced 

Disability: $780 per month

Bills: $770 monthly, not including gas (which is basically nothing now but is about 60 a month when working daily) and groceries, which is about $120 a month, so $890 total.

The extra $580 is going to be temporary, I know so I'm not sure how much I should be saving and how much I should be spending. If I get my job back in May, then the UI stops as well as the extra $580 a week. But who knows how long my job will be able to even pay me, if it will be able to reopen (I work in geriatrics)

My goal is to pay down the rest of the 3k balance and be able to pay my car insurance for a year in full (but am willing to sacrifice that if necessary).

If I pick stylishness and a low price, the clothes are usually very uncomfortable or fall apart because they&amp;#39;re cheap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked over my budget and their never seems to be enough cash for a new set of Jordans or a designer clothes that I&amp;#39;m eyeing. So how are my family members able to do it??&lt;/p&gt;

## Start saving

## Savings accounts

A saving account is a must. It needs to be one where you have at least a 30 day wait to access the money you have saved. I recommend having several savings accounts for different goals. Holiday account, emergency fund, car repairs/upgrade, family planning etc. The 30 day cooling off period will make it easier to avoid impulse purchases. 

## Start a pension

If I knew what starting a pension early could be worth at retirement I would have started much earlier and I would be much better off today as a result. If you don’t currently have a pension, close this tab and contact your bank about starting a pension right away. You are instantly retaining wealth through the tax that you will avoid on your contributions, never mind the interest that will compound over the next 30 years. 

## Cut Expenditure

## Mobile phone contracts

You don’t need the new iPhone with a 7 trillion pixel camera. Don’t get tricked into paying an unreasonable amount every month when you can get a decent Android for £100-200 and get unlimited calls, texts and minutes for £20 per month on pre pay.  If you have already been swindled into a crazy contract then don’t fall for the upgrade offers. 

## Buy in bulk – when the opportunity arises

Sometimes you find insane deals on daily necessities. Soap, shampoo, frozen food etc. When the opportunities capitalise and buy in bulk – just be sure that it’s something that you need and will definitely use before purchasing.

## Holidays/Trips

Many holiday [destinations are seriously overrated](https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2014/12/05/is-that-it). Are there any authentic traveling destinations left to be ruined by over eager salesmen, counterfeit goods merchants or assembly line excursions? 

Camping can be a very cost effective way to get away from your hometown for a while and explore a new area. And the best thing about this is that once you have the [essential equipment](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/family-camping-checklist.html), it’s basically free (apart from transport). 

If you really have the urge to travel I recommend making a travel bucket list and starting a savings account for the top spot, don’t compromise and overpay for average experiences.

## Scrap TV subscriptions

This can be a significant bill for many people. Do you really need access to 3,000 channels? There are significant savings to ridding yourself of entertainment bills. Replacing traditional satelitte ot cable TV with a Netflix or Prime account is a great start or perhaps you can “borrow” a friends login in. Better yet, opt out of subscription platforms completely and only use free services like YouTube and Vimeo or consider [Curiosity Stream](https://curiositystream.com/) which is currently just $11.99 per year and has all the documentaries you can watch. Podcasts have also come a long way in the last few years, there are many [free series](https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a26086091/best-podcasts/) that will keep you entertained. Oh, and there are also lots of books in your local library.

## Car expenses

If you have already taken out finance on a new car, accept my sincere apologies. The depreciation on new cars is disturbing. You literally drive out of the showroom several grand less well off. Not only that but you will be paying interest for the privilege of being ripped off. Ultimately, a car is something that gets you from a to b. You can get a mid 00s Toyota corolla for less than £2,000 which will never let you down and get similar fuel efficiency to the brand new models. When buying a used car, the most important factors you should be looking for are fuel efficiency and [reliability](https://www.reliabilityindex.com/), but always ask your mechanic to check out a used car before you buy. 

## Make your own coffee 

It has been a branding masterclass for the coffee giants we see on our highstreets. Some of them charge as high as £6 for a cup of coffee. If you are drinking 4 takeaway coffees a week, you may be spending over £1,000 on coffee per year. Put that figure into a [compounding interest calculator](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) and see if it’s worth it. You can get basically the exact same drink for a fraction of the price if you brew your own coffee at home. Also, there are a myriad of [sleep benefits](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/caffeine-and-sleep) if you cut caffeine out completely. 

## Cook at home &amp; take a packed lunch

If you eat lunch or dinner out more than 4 times a week you are probably spending more than you expect on food. Meal prepping at the start of the week is the best approach. So spend one evening making enough lunches and dinners for the week and keep them in the refrigerator or freezer for convenience microwave dinners. You will likely eat more [healthier ](https://www.onnit.com/academy/complete-guide-building-healthy-diet/)this way also as it will negate the effects of hunger cravings. ",t2_55nilrhj,False,,0,False,Guide: How to stop living paycheck to paycheck - Feedback welcomed,[],r/povertyfinance,False,6,,0,,False,t3_g4735b,False,dark,0.29,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Budgeting/Saving/Investing/Spending,False,0,,False,self,1587321569.0,,[],{},,,True,,1587329099.0,text,6,,,text,self.povertyfinance,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make extra money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sell unused stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have unused stuff lying around that someone might buy? It might be a good idea to declutter and sell off some of those items. You might be surprised what &lt;a href=""https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/14-weirdest-things-ever-sold-ebay/""&gt;people will buy online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"My fiancé got it by a car while crossing the street. It was a four way stop and the car wasn’t going insanely fast. I thought it wouldn’t be something gigantic. Now we are almost a year later. She is still in paid daily. After multiple Xrays, MRIs, and even a nerve test nothing has been found as the cause.

We have insurance through work, but we don’t make a ton of money with both of us in college, and living in our own apartment. I work part time and she’s on disability. We are paying thirty dollars twice weekly for a chiropractor, plus thirty for ever primary care visit, of course gas to go across town to get to these places. And I just got a bill in the mail for $250 dollars for an orthopedic that she went to, and will be going back to so she can get lidocaine shots to help the pain(hopefully). So expect a even larger bill for that.

This comes amid COVID, where luckily I’m getting paid still, my hours are capped lower than I would normally be working and medical insurance for both of us is $150 out of my paycheck biweekly.

She is in extremely high spirits during this, and I’m trying to be there with her. It’s hard to be her strength while also knowing we cannot pay these bills and also rent.

,povertyfinance,"the car is five years old and you can't afford to pay the car off in 3 years you can't afford the car.

Allow me to elaborate further. Owning a car you have multiple cost you have insurance maintenance and fuel. the longer you own an older car the more likely it is that you will have to put money into repairing it. The exception is Toyota's my family has always multiple old Toyotas and Lexus and all repair cost have been metamo. I see a lot of people fall into this low payment trap where the monthly payment is low but something happens to the car you still have your car payment plus you have your repair payment and that puts a lot of people and a bind. This is a rule of grown up listening to from my parents and I thought everybody knew this rule but I just had a friend go upside down on their car loan because I told her the same advice but she went and bought a car that she thought she deserved from getting her first big girl job. But with covet 19 it kind of puts her in the damper.

My strategy on cars is I bought a car in 2016 for $5,000 paid it off in 2019 and I made sure that the car wasn't going to depreciate any much further. I traded the car in few months ago for $3,500 and I got a 2013 model for the final price of $8,500. In 2023 I plan on trade my car in for at least $7,000 and getting a car that's asking 14,000 and final price is going to be 7000 because of the trade it.

In summary when you're young be smart if I your car purchases this is not the time to get the car that you want it's a time to get the car you need pay it off quick and get it to last as long as you possibly can.",t2_oicnr,False,,0,False,One golden rule to buy a car,[],r/povertyfinance,False,6,,0,,False,t3_g3p302,False,dark,0.63,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Budgeting/Saving/Investing/Spending,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1587251689.0,text,6,,,text,self.povertyfinance,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;the car is five years old and you can&amp;#39;t afford to pay the car off in 3 years you can&amp;#39;t afford the car.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of you are probably in the same predicament I'm currently in. Unemployment and on unemployment benefits until there's any assurance that we can work again. This month has been especially difficult because everyday we are left in the hands of a government that would rather protect millionaires than actually invest in the people that keep America moving. We were handled a check of $1,200 and expected to make it work without complaints. As far as unemployment, we were told that there would be a $600 increase in our weekly benefits. We were judged for it. Told that we don't deserve that much because most workers get paid less. Instead of the government being called to task for their lack of financial protection of essential workers, unemployed people who didn't want to lose their jobs were shamed. Throughout March and now April, the only people that had been consistently ridiculed about government assistance has been the poor and middle class. 

However, 40,000+ of America's millionaires are being gifted with a bailouts of $1,000,000 each. We are confined with mounting obligations like rent, utilities, etc. and are expected to be okay with one $1,200 check after being out of work for longer than a month. Yet, millionaires and hedge funds are walking away with million dollar checks. What. The. Fuck.

I'm just fed up. Don't know if people care anymore but I have to get this information out.

EDIT: As the defenders of millionaires will state, I have it wrong. This isn't a check to the rich. It's a tax break. Therefore, I shouldn't be mad. I shouldn't worry, there's enough $$$ for the rich.  They deserve just as much help as the poor.

It's bugger all for living expenses and it only works so well because I don't live urban. [1/3rd of my country lives in one city here, 1/2 live in our biggest 5 cities]

My fortnightly income is around 900 US 

My living expenses are 360 US

I finished university last year and I'm starting out in my field, had a big set back of 800 US getting this job because of an accident due to driving 12 hours in one day for the interview for the job. 

All up the funds goal is around 2200 US. I've cut everything across the board and made sure to move to a rural area so I could safe, the expenses per fortnight are down to.

Rent: 180 US

Food: 60 US [Food costs a lot more in my country than the U.S or Europe, and I have to eat meat or I get severely deficient in B12 :/]

Car: 25 US

Hobbies: 30 US [Swimming]

Car Maintenance fund: 50 US

Socializing: 25 US

But for US minimum wage numbers of working 80 hours over two weeks that'd be 580 USD, with this budget you have 220 USD left over.

My country is a first world western nation, it's not easy living on so little but if you just keep acting like you're still in university you can keep the life style creep down. For the record I'm living like this due to a mix of family medical expenses/housing expenses, my parents need a new roof for their house and my dads an invalid for the last 6 years so things have been tough. My cars 22 years old but Civics are a reliable model and I'll ride it until something major under the hood goes, everything I own can fit in it but I only have a 1 year contract and could move to a different island for work if I need to so owning lots isn't really a smart decision. 

If you can train in a skill or career that leaves you employable in towns smaller than 10k people you can really keep your expenses down. Even if it's just for a year you can get a lot of breathing space, you give up a lot but you do what you need to do. 

If things go okay I should be able to save 12k US which should be enough to get a new 40 year steel roof for my parents place which will last 'em till they die in that house.

I've been a long time lurker of this sub on various accounts and a lot of advice has been helpful. But I just wanted to share that it can get better and for the younger people possibly considering an apprenticeship or tertiary education to really think about where you can get work. My jobs a government job so pay is static no matter where you life, if I lived in our city with 33% of the population I'd be struggling to save anything. A lot of my friends got pigeonholed into that city because of what they studied and it's been really rough for them to try and get their head above water.

&lt;p&gt;This week, we switched gears and branched out to a new division for our products. It has been a huge turning point. I no longer need to take a pay cut to keep my job. We are going to be beyond busy in the next two weeks, forecasting into the entire summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up the mail, and our mortgage rate was also successfully reduced due to a drop in prime. All my bills are paid for the month. My paycheque hit my account last night and I finally broke down into tears. There was no reduction. It was a full pay cheque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always prepare for the worst. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"I have seen that people are receiving their Stimulus check money by direct deposit. I hope this is not a stupid question, but I have done research and I’m really worried that I am not going to be able to get my money. I didn’t find any solutions to this problem during my research and I don’t have anyone else to ask for advice from so I’m asking here. Maybe someone else has the same question and could use some helpful advice as well.

So, in 2018 I had my taxes direct deposited to the checking account I had at the time. I no longer have that account. Is the IRS going to send the money to that account. Will they realize that the account is closed and send the money another way? I receive temporary assistance (welfare), will they put the money on my benefit card? 

I have already been to the IRS website to change my information. It keeps telling me that I am unable to submit the form. Is there any way that I can contact the IRS directly to notify them of the change? Like everyone else, I really need the money as I cannot work and have recently lost my food stamps. My public assistance is only $20 twice a month. It’s certainly not enough but I have been surviving. I received some help on here that helped me out so much. The only problem is that I cannot depend on strangers to help me I need to find some way to survive on my own. I have a place to stay for now, but I have to find a room for rent or back in a shelter because I cannot stay with my boyfriend once his parents come back from Florida. They normally would be home by now but the coronavirus has kept them down there. They won’t allow me to stay. I have a bad feeling that I won’t make it through this pandemic without some serious financial help, that’s why this is so important to me.

,povertyfinance,"&gt;**(Washington, D.C., April 17, 2020)** – U.S. Secretary of  Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced approval of the **District of  Columbia (DC) and North Carolina**’s requests to provide online purchasing  of food to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Households.  This approval will allow the State and Federal District to expedite the  implementation of online purchasing with currently authorized SNAP  online retailers with a target start date to be announced at a later  time. DC’s SNAP participation is over 100,000 individuals, more than  66,000 households, and totals nearly $200 million annually in federal  funding. North Carolina’s SNAP participation is over 1.2 million  individuals, almost 600,000 households, and totals nearly $1.7 billion  annually in federal funding.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The [SNAP online pilot](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot)  is currently operational in Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Oregon,  and Washington State. Nebraska joined the pilot on April 1, 2020. The  authorized retailers working with all pilot states are Amazon and  Walmart, while Wrights Market and ShopRite are working with Alabama and  New York respectively. On April 8, it was [announced](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/04/08/arizona-and-california-added-innovative-snap-online-pilot-program) that Arizona and California would be joining, and on April 11 [announced](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/04/11/florida-and-idaho-added-innovative-snap-online-pilot-program) Florida and Idaho.

Some Massachusetts legislators are currently striving to get MA added to the list as well.

,povertyfinance,"Coming out of college in 2018, I had a lot of debt and not a lot of income. I knew I had to get my finances in order but have never been good at budgeting or tracking. I never had a solid grasp of where the hell my money was going. So, soon after school ended I made a saving plan that I’ve considered “organizing your finances for people who don’t want to think about it”, since I am very much in that camp. Knowing that I’m the type of person that just won’t track expenses, I tried to sync and combine different tips I gathered from Reddit to make something that works around my habits. The below method is great for those who don’t like to track their daily expenses with complex spreadsheets, apps, etc. It requires up-front planning and setting up, but then I consider it to be pretty smooth sailing after.

With that said, I’m by no means an expert in budgeting or financial planning - so as much as I’m hoping this could help others like myself, I’m also hoping someone can give me tips on how to make this a more effective plan. I don’t think there’s anything novel about the plan I made for myself, but I’ve used it for those around me and have gotten good reception so I figured I share. I’d appreciate all feedback, even if you suggest I scrap this plan altogether. Here we go!

*DISCLAIMER: I mention the service Qapital here a few times. I’m not trying to push this service on anybody. This is simply what I chose to go with for myself. In fact, I’d love to hear some alternatives because I did not look very far for my “Second account/savings” solution that I cover.*

1. Determine your expected take-home pay every month (take note of payment frequency as well, per paycheck). Give a conservative estimate, one you can be pretty confident in taking home every time.
2. Determine list of all fixed monthly expenses (aka monthly bills). When it comes to debt payments, just jot down the minimum payments for them.
3. Determine generous estimate of variable but necessary expenses (aka groceries, gas, toll, etc). To do this, you can look at your past bank statements in the past 30-90 days to estimate what you’ve spent in each category per month… assuming you haven’t been tracking your expenditures.
4. Add the totals from steps 2 and 3. This will be the amount of money you’ll put in your “bills account”. It should sum to an amount that is less than your total monthly take home pay, ideally!
5. The leftover will be the funds for your “miscellaneous spending account”. This is not only for fun money, but for all expenses not covered by steps 2 and 3 - things you don’t regularly buy or budget for (hygiene products, cleaning stuff, eating out, booze, clothes, etc)
6. However, you should hopefully be able to also set aside some of that money to save/pay debt. This is where you’ll need to curb bad spending habits, so that your misc spending funds can stretch.
7. Now with your two “funds” separated, you’ll want to open up a separate bank/debit account to separate them. My existing account was with Bank of America, so I opened up my second account with Qapital. This plan includes a banking account and debit card, as well as convenient ways to automate my savings and set them aside.
8. To split the funds into separate accounts, your job should allow you to split up where your direct deposit goes into. If not, have your income deposited into one account (I recommend going into the Bills account), and then use Qapital savings rules (or whatever service you choose) to transfer funds to your misc spending account upon receiving paycheck.
9. Set up auto pay for as many bills as you can on the bills account. And use this account only for your bills and necessary variable expenses. This way, you’ll use this card way less and it can be more out of sight out of mind.
10. Use the other account only for your misc expenses. This is where you’ll want to save as much as you can as well.
11. Now that you have your money separated, figure out how much you can save from your misc expenses every month, and set up saving rules in Qapital (or whatever you choose) to automate savings. Basically, you can treat this as a monthly expense if your income is steady.
12. If using Qapital or similar savings service, these savings can split up into multiple saving buckets if you’d like. For example, I save into one bucket for an emergency fund or to pay towards CC debt, but I also have a savings bucket for “large fun money purchases” like gifts, tickets, etc. I also did a temporary savings bucket for moving expenses.
13. This should be everything you need to know where your money is going. This will provide you with the ability to automate saving, and spend “freely”, with the peace of mind that you are not spending more than you can afford.
14. Expenses can change every now and then, even subtly, so it’s always good to repeat steps 1-3 to audit your expenses every few months, and re-calibrate your splits if needed.

Now, if you want to plan your finances to start developing a savings fund and tackle debt:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Write down a full list of your debts. What kind of debts, how much the minimum monthly payments are, and the interest rate for each debt.
2. Order the debts by highest interest rate. You’ll want to pay these off first.
3. But before paying off debts, you’ll want to develop an emergency savings account. From what I hear, the basic rule of thumb is to save 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency savings. This is the safest, however if you want to be aggressive in tackling debt ASAP and think your current job is stable and safe, you can go lower if you’re comfortable with that. Call me risky, but I only have saved $1000 as my emergency fund, which is the absolute lowest I was willing to save (reconsidering now with COVID recession). Use your savings rules to make an emergency bucket.
4. Once you’ve completed your emergency fund target, you’re ready to put extra money towards debt. So, pay the minimum on every debt, except for the debt balance with the highest interest rate (your credit card). You’ll want to throw the rest of your money towards this credit card to pay it down as fast as possible.
5. Eventually you’ll pay that first debt off, then you’ll apply all the monthly money towards the next debt, until you eventually eliminate your debt. Voila!

Okay, that’s basically everything I know. As said above, I’m not at all saying this is the best way to approach your personal finances, but I just wanted to share what has worked for me and for others I’ve shown this to. I’d love to hear how this plan can be made better.

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I’m by no means an expert in budgeting or financial planning - so as much as I’m hoping this could help others like myself, I’m also hoping someone can give me tips on how to make this a more effective plan. I don’t think there’s anything novel about the plan I made for myself, but I’ve used it for those around me and have gotten good reception so I figured I share. I’d appreciate all feedback, even if you suggest I scrap this plan altogether. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISCLAIMER: I mention the service Qapital here a few times. I’m not trying to push this service on anybody. This is simply what I chose to go with for myself. In fact, I’d love to hear some alternatives because I did not look very far for my “Second account/savings” solution that I cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine your expected take-home pay every month (take note of payment frequency as well, per paycheck). Give a conservative estimate, one you can be pretty confident in taking home every time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine list of all fixed monthly expenses (aka monthly bills). When it comes to debt payments, just jot down the minimum payments for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine generous estimate of variable but necessary expenses (aka groceries, gas, toll, etc). To do this, you can look at your past bank statements in the past 30-90 days to estimate what you’ve spent in each category per month… assuming you haven’t been tracking your expenditures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the totals from steps 2 and 3. This will be the amount of money you’ll put in your “bills account”. It should sum to an amount that is less than your total monthly take home pay, ideally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The leftover will be the funds for your “miscellaneous spending account”. This is not only for fun money, but for all expenses not covered by steps 2 and 3 - things you don’t regularly buy or budget for (hygiene products, cleaning stuff, eating out, booze, clothes, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, you should hopefully be able to also set aside some of that money to save/pay debt. This is where you’ll need to curb bad spending habits, so that your misc spending funds can stretch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now with your two “funds” separated, you’ll want to open up a separate bank/debit account to separate them. My existing account was with Bank of America, so I opened up my second account with Qapital. This plan includes a banking account and debit card, as well as convenient ways to automate my savings and set them aside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To split the funds into separate accounts, your job should allow you to split up where your direct deposit goes into. If not, have your income deposited into one account (I recommend going into the Bills account), and then use Qapital savings rules (or whatever service you choose) to transfer funds to your misc spending account upon receiving paycheck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up auto pay for as many bills as you can on the bills account. And use this account only for your bills and necessary variable expenses. This way, you’ll use this card way less and it can be more out of sight out of mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the other account only for your misc expenses. This is where you’ll want to save as much as you can as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you have your money separated, figure out how much you can save from your misc expenses every month, and set up saving rules in Qapital (or whatever you choose) to automate savings. Basically, you can treat this as a monthly expense if your income is steady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If using Qapital or similar savings service, these savings can split up into multiple saving buckets if you’d like. For example, I save into one bucket for an emergency fund or to pay towards CC debt, but I also have a savings bucket for “large fun money purchases” like gifts, tickets, etc. I also did a temporary savings bucket for moving expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This should be everything you need to know where your money is going. This will provide you with the ability to automate saving, and spend “freely”, with the peace of mind that you are not spending more than you can afford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expenses can change every now and then, even subtly, so it’s always good to repeat steps 1-3 to audit your expenses every few months, and re-calibrate your splits if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you want to plan your finances to start developing a savings fund and tackle debt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down a full list of your debts. What kind of debts, how much the minimum monthly payments are, and the interest rate for each debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order the debts by highest interest rate. You’ll want to pay these off first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But before paying off debts, you’ll want to develop an emergency savings account. From what I hear, the basic rule of thumb is to save 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency savings. This is the safest, however if you want to be aggressive in tackling debt ASAP and think your current job is stable and safe, you can go lower if you’re comfortable with that. Call me risky, but I only have saved $1000 as my emergency fund, which is the absolute lowest I was willing to save (reconsidering now with COVID recession). Use your savings rules to make an emergency bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve completed your emergency fund target, you’re ready to put extra money towards debt. So, pay the minimum on every debt, except for the debt balance with the highest interest rate (your credit card). You’ll want to throw the rest of your money towards this credit card to pay it down as fast as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually you’ll pay that first debt off, then you’ll apply all the monthly money towards the next debt, until you eventually eliminate your debt. Voila!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s basically everything I know. As said above, I’m not at all saying this is the best way to approach your personal finances, but I just wanted to share what has worked for me and for others I’ve shown this to. I’d love to hear how this plan can be made better. Hope this helps you in some way!&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"I applied for SNAP last week. Randomly decided to check the DTA Connect app(I'm in MA) to see if my application had started to be processed yet(you can't even log in if your case isn't active or pending in the system). So I enter my social and birth year(that's the info you access your account with, not you card number &lt;----important) expecting to see that my case is pending, and I'm waiting for a phone interview. Instead, I found a balance. $400. Not only did I already get approved and get the usual $194 for the month, but apparently they are giving people extra(one-time deal I think) to help buy more groceries. Now, I never received any kind of notice, no calls, no mail, no message in the app, etc. So I had no idea that it had actually already been sitting there a few days. Huzzah, I can eat! Right? LMAO! Oh, you poor, naive fools.

I dug out my EBT card and popped it back into my wallet. Took my last $12 in cash and bribed a family member with a car to let me go to the grocery store with them when they went, so I can buy *finally* buy food. And oh man, did I plan to finally stock up. No hoarding of 50  boxes of pasta or whatever, but I filled a cart. Reasonable amounts of pasta, big bags of rice and dry black beans, flour/yeast/other baking goods, a few big jugs of oil, an assortment of dry spices, canned tuna, salsa, and a fair few other assorted items. Anything that I could get my hands on, before the actual hoarders take what's left. Enough stuff to make a TON of meals without having to keep going back out.

Wait in line. And wait. And wait. And wait some more. Finally, it's my turn. Load all of my items up, watching as they get scanned through, wondering if I want crack open the yeast and prep dough for garlic bread, or if I'd rather work on making flat bread pizza crusts. Finally, the items are all scanned. ""Your total is $188""(or about that much, I forget exactly). I swipe my card and enter my PIN. *Unable to process payment* appears on the screen. Oh. Maybe I entered the PIN wrong. Tried again. And a third time. A fouth. Still unable to process payment. Cashier is looking unimpressed. The line of people behind me even less so. Nevermind the *usual* shame and embarrassment people seem to love to impose on anyone paying with an EBT card. So I bust out my phone, thinking surely there must be an issue with the PIN and can reset it as quickly as humanly possible, pay, and GTFO. I call the number, which has the automated system start spewing out crap at me about a hundred different notices about COVID-19, and benefits have already been dispursed to people, and blah blah blah. *Finally*, it lets me enter my card number. I'm expecting to hear ""your balance is..."" and then ""If you are having issues with..."" etc. Nope. Instead, I hear ""The card number you have entered has been deactivated. If you are eligible to be issued a new card, one will be mailed to you in X number of days. Or you can call blah blah blah.""

Yup. Turns out that they decided that my existing card, which is perfectly good, as I have had it since the first time I ever got SNAP, and used it as recently as December, is not good enough. They gave me food money, made me think I could buy food, but also immediately decided to deactivate the card so I can't actually buy food with it. 

So instead, I got no food, and I got to look like a complete fucking asshole in front of a store full of people, in the middle of a pandemic, where people are trying to buy food, and some poor bastard had to take my entire cart of groceries, and presumably put it off somewhere where no one else can even buy any of it because I've already handled it all.

,povertyfinance,"I've had several months in a row where in the last couple of weeks I just had no money to spare. The utilities stayed on and there was food, but only if I was creative about menus and cooking. This month, I did bring a critical bill up to date and covered a medical expense, but had zero dollars for the last half of the month. Not the worst situation in the world, but really feeling the stress of it.

Should I use the $1200 to pay off my $1000 debt or keep the cash for now since I’m jobless?&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Hi so I’m [20M] and currently unemployed in Colorado. I moved from NY back in October. I was working full time at a regional barbershop as a receptionist before COVID. Over the summer however I worked for 4 months at Walmart back in NY. 

I tried to file for unemployment in Colorado and you had to have made 2500 dollars between Jan 1 and Dec 31 2019. I was short like 200 dollars with all my paychecks added up from October. So I don’t qualify for unemployment here. And I don’t have my paychecks from Walmart to file for unemployment in New York. 

Also my mom claimed me on her taxes so I don’t get the stimulus check either. 

I have 2000 dollars in credit card debt that is really just looming over my head and crushing my credit score by the day. I had to get a credit card at 18 to pay for counseling and when I had meningitis, my mom had me foot the 500 dollar hospital bill. I then got a second credit card through PayPal during Christmas season 2018. I thought I would get everyone what they wanted that year. BIG MISTAKE. 600 dollars later and I still haven’t been able to pay it off. PayPal calls me 10+ times a day. I have no savings either. Currently I have about 200 dollars to my name. 

I can only afford to pay rent, groceries, and my phone bill. And I haven’t had a new source of income in the last month. I haven’t been able to pay April’s rent for this month either. I’ve recently resorted to asking my coworkers for money and some of them Venmo’d me which was awesome! I was cruising reddit though and turns out there’s a lot of good financial advice and material here. 

So that’s what I’m asking I guess? What’s device do you have? How do I pay this off? What works to make money while in quarantine?

,povertyfinance,"Hello Reddit! 

Sorry if I incorrectly do something on this post, it's my first comment/post ever (or if I missed common questions)!

I recently moved back into my family home to help my parents with my five siblings during the COVID-19 pandemic. I have worked/college study full-time for the last 5 years. I lived by my college and handled all my personal finances and currently, I'm in my last year in school with no debt. I am not educated in anything tax-related, I know how to do my taxes but that's about it.  

My family has always struggled financially. I don't know much about my parent's finances, but I do know they've had to take out multiple mortgages and I have helped with expenses from time to time when basic things like food or toiletries have been needed. 

My father keeps shitty records of his jobs and expenses and I know that he always owes money with taxes. He doesn't keep any business records of tool expenses or miles driven or car repairs. He uses the garage as his workshop, his personal car as transportation, and his personal tools to work with. He uses a personal phone for business and our home computer for everything else.  

I just want to know where to start so that I can help him save money for the sake of my siblings. My siblings and I are capable of getting just enough funds on our own for our personal expenses as most of us have jobs, but if there was any sort of family emergency we have absolutely nothing to fall back on at home. 

If there's any apps or websites that would work well for tracking, and what actually is a business expense and how can you get deductions for that?  I know we are at or just above the poverty line  set by California standards! 

Anything is greatly appreciated!

&lt;p&gt;My father keeps shitty records of his jobs and expenses and I know that he always owes money with taxes. He doesn&amp;#39;t keep any business records of tool expenses or miles driven or car repairs. He uses the garage as his workshop, his personal car as transportation, and his personal tools to work with. He uses a personal phone for business and our home computer for everything else.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to know where to start so that I can help him save money for the sake of my siblings. My siblings and I are capable of getting just enough funds on our own for our personal expenses as most of us have jobs, but if there was any sort of family emergency we have absolutely nothing to fall back on at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s any apps or websites that would work well for tracking, and what actually is a business expense and how can you get deductions for that?  I know we are at or just above the poverty line  set by California standards! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything is greatly appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks All!!!&lt;/p&gt;

3 credit cards paid off in full, 2 medical bills paid off.  Quick stop at the vet to pay the last $300 our pooch needs for surgery to fix a cracked tooth and got the appt set for Monday.  Full tank of gas, 6 months of car insurance paid.  Lights and water bill for month of April paid.  After paying May's rent, we have $800, $400 of it was going to go to stocking up our freezer and the rest into savings.

out of curiosity, I checked our food stamp balance to make sure our $72 we get in month was on there. (no one near max for 6 people-due to income) We don't use our food stamps first half of the month, we save it till the last 2 weeks of the month when we're getting short on cash.

There's a lot of misinformation going around about these SBA Loans:
 
- Freelancers and independent contractors can apply even if not registered as a business.  

- If you apply for $1000 and take it as an advance, it does not have to be paid back!

I’m wondering if I’ll get a stimulus check or not? I don’t want the “Can you be claimed?” To mess me up even though I wasn’t. I even got the American opportunity education tax credit this year that dependents are not eligible for.

,povertyfinance,"So I’m in a bit of a dilema and I apologize in advance if this post doesn’t belong here. A little backstory, I moved from FL to NY and had my car towed up here.

This was compounded by the fact that our new apt building has a waiting list for parking so right now my car is parked upstate not being driven at all.

Yesterday I got a letter in the mail from Florida DMV saying they will suspend my license in about 5 days if I don’t send back the plates or prove I have insurance or that I no longer own the car.

&lt;p&gt;Not sure of what other info is needed - I don’t make too much but my monthly bills are mostly just rent/cc payments. Any advice helps!!&lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Just looking for advice here since I seem to have a few options - but I have no idea which one is best in the long run... Long story short, I bought a 2013 Hyundai Elantra from an old coworker about 7 months ago, seemed like he took care of it well and only 38k miles. Fast forward to now and the engine is blown, no warranty. I have a giant paperweight at the moment.

My personal financial situation is not fantastic. 6 months ago I took a sales job with the expectation of making just under double my previous income. While I am doing well, between training for a month, winter sales dip and now quarantine (I count myself lucky to still be working, others were laid off), I am making slightly more these months but definitely not as much as I'd hoped - yet. I had gotten myself to a low point of debt, bills, etc, and while I am getting everything caught up, my credit score is low 500's and I am upside down about $4500 in a car that doesn't run and is 1 month's payment behind as of right now, and only about $900 in my accounts - which really should be held towards this month's bills.

I have a couple options but am looking for what you guys think is the best path:

1) Have a new or used engine put in my current paperweight. ($1800 - $3000)
2) Attempt to finance myself at a high interest rate with an approx. $16,000 car with incentives to mitigate the negative equity. Work harder at fixing credit to refinance ASAP.
3) Cosign with my mother (swallowing pride here) for an approx. $16,000 car at a much lower interest rate.

Any advice or other ideas greatly appreciated. I am &lt;was&gt; also doing food delivery on my off times to supplement income to pay bills down/catch up.

This post is not medical advice, but rather a way to save money on certain medications.\n\nSometimes doctors will prescribe things like Iron, Vitamin D, or other Vitamins to treat a condition.  These are available over the counter, so a prescription is generally not required.\n\nHowever, if your doctor sends these in to the pharmacy, you will pay less than the OTC retail price.\n\nFor example, Iron supplements range from $6-$15 for 65mg, 100 tablets.

If ANYONE can offer me some advice, I'd really appreciate it!!!

Today, Sunday April 12th, I am supposed to be receiving my second week of unemployment. However, I have not even been able to get the first week of claims put in my account!! Last week, Sunday 5th, I went to the Georgia Department of Labor site, and entered in my pin and SS. (My claim had already been approved.) But after entering the information, it said I can't claim my benefits! Today I tried again, and it said the same thing!!

I don't know what I'm doing wrong - my claim already says it's been processed and accepted, and all I have to do is type in my pin and SS. But...nothing happens and I am refused every time! 

I'm worried, because not only am I in serious need of the money, I don't want to get in trouble for being unable to claim my own claim. I don't know how to access the money either.

Should I just cancel my claim even though I've not received any money? If so, how do I go about doing this?

And the last thing: my employer (retail job) sent me a link to claim benefits from them. I don't know if this a stimulus check, and neither does my employer! And by the time I received this link, I'd already filed my own unemployment claim. I can't file two claims, right??

My job is, barring any massive increase in severity with Covid19(like mass infections at work), fairly secure. Considering the rural nature of most of SC, it was one of the last places to issue a shelter order. And it's not effective at all. Besides some businesses being closed, its business as usual here. Nothing is being enforced. But that's besides the point.

I have been working on my credit for the last year and it's now above the 650s. My job has increased our pay by $5 an hour and is paying all base medical and dental premiums as hazard benefits until ""the end of the covid19 situation"". So I'm actually even more financially stable now during Corona than I was before. Very weird. Add to the 2900$ stimulus coming my way and I'm going to have well over 5K savings.

So here's the thing, I can't live like this anymore. Always renting cheap shitty places in bad neighborhoods to save money. I'm done. And I want out. I'm tired of the constant thefts, break ins in the neighborhood, vandalism of my property. I have to keep my outside washer/dryer shed locked tight or these assholes will steal the God damn clothes. This plan started a year ago and has taken longer than I would have liked to get to this point. My wife's parents live on 12 acres. They are gifting us 3 acres and we will be putting a manufactured home on it. We are buying new from a dealer (Please don't try to convince me otherwise, this is 100% what we are doing. I have gone over all the pros and cons a thousand times). 

Now I was hoping to do a USDA loan as it gives me the greatest flexibility with out of pocket cash. Does anyone know how this covid19 situation is going to affect federally backed programs like USDA and FHA? I assume a manufactured home dealer is going to suffer similar effects that the housing market will. Is there any data showing that it's worth waiting longer? (I'm hoping to get the ball started in about 4 months. I'm dealing with 2 last issues on my report). 

My financial situation is this

Avg 655 FICO

5.2k savings after stimulus

18k 401k (lost 2k during crash)

43k yr (will be more with wage increase but its considered temporary so I'm not going to bother extrapolating it)

Rural SC

USDA income and area eligible

Wife is SAHM who works under the table cleaning for a couple clients. She's had both for years. We can get by on my income. Her income is usually for anything extra curricular (eating out, family day, date night etc.) So it's not necessary for us to make it. 

House price 100k (max is 110k). This includes delivery and set up.

My savings is likely to increase a fair bit over the next 4 months due to wage increase. My 401k is going to be an emergency backup for any unforeseen expenses but I hope it won't come to that. But it's nice to have that cushion if I need it.

&lt;p&gt;Wife is SAHM who works under the table cleaning for a couple clients. She&amp;#39;s had both for years. We can get by on my income. Her income is usually for anything extra curricular (eating out, family day, date night etc.) So it&amp;#39;s not necessary for us to make it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;House price 100k (max is 110k). This includes delivery and set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My savings is likely to increase a fair bit over the next 4 months due to wage increase. My 401k is going to be an emergency backup for any unforeseen expenses but I hope it won&amp;#39;t come to that. But it&amp;#39;s nice to have that cushion if I need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not well versed on the housing market on a complex level so I was hoping somebody might have some good insight on this. Most articles I read are only about site built homes and usually in wealthier areas.&lt;/p&gt;

So this is a weird question, but here's the timeline:

We only make $5.44 an hour plus our tips, The tips are our life. I don't want his paycheck I will do better on unemployment, some small companies are telling their employees they will be fired if they don't accept their checks.  Is this for real?  I hope I put this in the right subcategory.

,povertyfinance,"Hello,

I got divorced September 2019 and one of the sections in our divorce decree mentions how I will be the one to claim the kids from then on. I’ve read some articles that say that doesn’t hold much weight if he decides to claim them anyway BUT they lived with me solely for the last 8 months of the year. 

I had to paper file my taxes since he claimed the kids, thus delaying my return. Now that the stimulus checks will be sent out and my return hasn’t been finalized, my understanding is that they will use my 2018 return. I filed my 2018 return as married filing separately and he claimed all three kids. 

So from that I see, he will get the $500 for each kid, is that correct? I’m at such a loss at this moment because he doesn’t deserve to keep a penny that belongs to his kids. He unfairly his refund from claiming them and now this money.

Almost to the point of obsession and it felt very unhealthy to me. If you're trying your best and you're just getting by, that's alright. You'll get there.*

That's a loaded statement right there. Let me qualify it.

You're in debt. Mountains of it. It's stressing you out. You pull up Credit Karma to see how you're doing and you see that you've taken another hit again. Down another 45 points. It is in that moment that you feel desperation wash over you. Things will never get better from here. You're feeling anxiety, depression and it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders.

I'm telling you from that moment on that you need to stop looking at your credit score for the time being and maybe until things get better for you.

Now, that isn't to say you shouldn't check in on your account to make sure that there's no funky activity going on, but if you are in a situation of debt that is stressing you out, worrying about your credit score is only going to make things worse.

Maybe you don't care about your credit score. That's okay. This isn't for you.

This is for the person who's made so many mistakes in life that the only thing they feel right now is regret and overwhelm over those financial decisions that took them down a bad path. You've got a lot of unsecured debt or student loans and you're struggling just to get by right now let alone pay down your debt. 

But you're managing. Every month, you throw an extra $5 on that credit card minimum. It doesn't feel like much, but it's enough. It's the best you can do.

But every month, you get that notification that your credit score's updated and there's no change. Worse yet, it's come down another 5, 10, 15 points. Each day it gets harder and harder to stomach how you're not getting ahead. It just feels bleak for you.

In that moment it's so easy to forget how well you've been doing. When you're in a bad situation, sometimes managing is the best you can do. And that's okay.

You are underselling just how hard it is to legitimately tackle debt. 

Debt is an albatross around most people's necks. And by a lot of financial ""experts"" we're taught to hate ourselves for getting in debt. It feels like we should be ashamed for making bad financial decisions in life or maybe taking the wrong degree in school. It seems like *everybody* wants to be Dave Ramsey and treat you like you're dumb. Like you should be ashamed.

But I'm here to tell you that we all make mistakes. And mistakes are nothing to be ashamed of even if you're paying for them right now. But as long as you know you're doing your best, *that's okay*. You're not bad or any worse than the rest of us. Welcome to being human.

So what is your best? Only you can tell you what that is. You know your limits. Maybe you need to push yourself a little farther every day. But it's okay if you don't if you're just holding your head above water right now. And one day you'll get out of it. But until then, it's okay just to manage.

So free yourself of the stress. Know that eventually it will be okay and your work will pay off. And then maybe you can focus on getting that credit score right again but until that moment in time, I am freeing you from the guilt and anxiety and fear of opening up that page. Because your credit score is fucked *and that's okay right now.* Keep your head above water today so you can focus on tomorrow. 

You need to accept that for the moment there is nothing you can do beyond climbing that mountain one step at a time. But as long as you set your sights at the top, you'll get there.

But I get it. We all love to rubberneck when there's an accident on the highway. But tackling debt is a marathon, not a sprint. And nothing but time will improve your situation. It will get better eventually.",t2_4ls2budp,False,,0,False,Don't look at your credit score,[],r/povertyfinance,False,6,,0,,False,t3_fznm8c,False,dark,0.63,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Vent/Rant,False,8,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1586684441.0,text,6,,,text,self.povertyfinance,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did not write this to talk down to anyone.

,povertyfinance,"My sister and my mom both started working in the housekeeping department at a local hotel recently. My sister in mid November and my mom in early January. It was my sisters first job since 2018, she’s been at home since she had her baby boy and my mom had been working for the postal service part time as a rural carrier but it wasn’t as steady as promised and so she only grossed 10,000 or so for 2019. They both filed taxes for 2019.

In late March the hotel decided to shut down until May 1st, possibly later. The hotel hr dept had them file for partial unemployment through the hotel, and they were denied due to only being employees for a short time. So they are scheduled to get 0.00 from the state of Georgia from this. Is this because they filed for partial unemployment through their employer? 

Should they file through the normal dept of labor website for normal unemployment? Is there any way they can appeal this? Will they still receive any of the federal stimulus check? What steps can they take right now to help themselves stay financially stable right now?

Since I was 13 years old, my goal in life was to get a job (and date but that's another subject). I never knew how people got a job though and so I recreated it. Anything and everything was like a job to me.

And so I got carried away in my little bubble world of pseudo-jobs. In fact, I honestly do not believe I have been ""unemployed"" in a sense that all my philosophy regarding any activity was the economics of the situations.

,povertyfinance,"I work in a claims department and it's actually both surprising and sad that a lot of people don't know what their deductible is, or find they have none at all. 

So let's attack the first issue.

I see a lot of people with $0 and $100 deductibles. 

It's better to have either a $500 or $1,000 deductible, granted if you can put that much away in savings.

Here's why, say you are 30 right now and will carry insurance for the rest of your life. But let's just pick 10 years.

If the difference between a $0 deductible and a $500 one is even $20 per month, you will have paid $2,400 in premium differences over the life of 10 years, and $4,800 in 20 years.

So obviously the better choice would to be to save $500 and then keep it squirreled away, maybe in a high yield savings account. 

Shockingly, I see a lot of middle class folks with $0 deductibles, which quite frankly is throwing money away. If they are 30 and drive for the next 40 years, they have spent almost $10,000, or 1/3rd the price of an average new car.

The second one is not having full coverage at all. 

Now it was true at some time that having full coverage on a $300 or $500 car didn't make since, but used cars have gone up quite a bit in the past 10-15 years.

If something happens to your car, then obviously paying the $500 would be much easier than trying to come up with 2 to 3 grand for even a reliable set of wheels (that's what the cheapest used cars go for here).

Sadly I learned the last one the hard way.",t2_33sqykx9,False,,0,False,"Please... for the love of god, check your car insurance.",[],r/povertyfinance,False,6,,0,,False,t3_fyvtjj,False,dark,0.78,,public,16,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Misc Advice,False,16,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1586605523.0,text,6,,,text,self.povertyfinance,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in a claims department and it&amp;#39;s actually both surprising and sad that a lot of people don&amp;#39;t know what their deductible is, or find they have none at all. &lt;/p&gt;

,povertyfinance,"Please be gentle. For all intents and purposes, I’ve had 0 guidance on this and have been going through adult finances by myself. I could be doing something ridiculous, I genuinely have no idea.

Given the COVID-19 crisis, and daycares being closed indefinitely in our area, my employer has given us the option to change our Dependent Care FSA deductions.

Currently I have $75 a pay (EOW) come out. That essentially takes a *slight* chunk out of my kids daycare weekly bill, when they’re there. 

I’ve always done anything and everything I can with HSA/FSA because they’re pre-tax money, and I’ve always been told that’s good. Admittedly, I’m not 100% sure why, I’ve just kind of been perpetuating this idea.

To be blunt, my income is 35k pre-tax. I also have a medical FSA coming out $75 every pay. I claim 1, and have 3 kids. My refunds are usually sizable.

My question is am I able to let this DCA continue to come out, and if for some reason I have too much in the account and can’t use it for 2020 services, can I just write the excess to the daycare forward for future services? Example, if it get to be 12/31 and I have $1500 left but they obviously won’t be going back in 2020, can I write that $1500 to the daycare for future services to use it?

Or should I dial it back now? My concern is I don’t know if it will affect my taxes at all.

,povertyfinance,"Hey all, 

Part of me wants to share some happiness, part of me wants to tell people and not feel guilty about it, and a  part of me would love some advice! 

So amongst so many horrible job losses and financial stress my husband has managed to secure a full time ongoing position in an essential service. The CEO of the company has guaranteed them their salary throughout the crisis. They leant him a company car so that he doesn’t have to take the bus in during COVID. It’s ridiculous, and we are both in shock I think. 

For 4 years now, he has been (at best) sporadically employed, he was working in a dying industry that would only hire hourly. That industry has essentially been killed by COVID-19. As he is not a citizen of my country, he was ineligible for unemployment during that time. 

So we’ve been living almost exclusively off my grad-school stipend. Barely enough to cover the rent. We’ve eaten a lot of beans and rice. On top of that, my health care expenses can be expensive (chronic illness). 

It’s an entry level salary so not huge or anything, but hell, it’s something, and it’s stable! Far more than zero, which he earned for most of this time. He worked so damn hard to get out of his old industry. I’m so proud of him. 

I grew up in the welfare system so tbh, this has all been pretty normal for me. Stressful, but a stress that is normalised. It’s been harder for him. The stability we’ve just been granted doesn’t feel real. 

Thankfully, we don’t have a lot of debt, I have a $1000 credit card that has $100 left on it. I expect we will pay that off pretty quickly now. 

I’m so incredibly grateful. I also have no idea how NOT to live pay check to pay check. After tax, we’ve more than doubled our income (to ~40k usd with current exchange rate). It’s probably nothing to some, but to me this is huge. I know we can live as we have been doing in terms of spending but I think allowing ourselves a bit more breathing room will be good for us - just not too much! 

There are things I know we both want to do, we haven’t bought new clothes in all that time and they are very ratty. We’d like to go to the dentist (once covid is over). I’d like to get a haircut (once covid is over). 

The joy we feel is definitely battling with the survivors’ guilt we feel. 

Any advice on remaining calm and thoughtful with money, and how to start ... I don’t know... looking after it? would be greatly appreciated! My financial literacy is woeful. 

TL;DR After 4 years of ~unemployment, and us living off my grad school stipend, my husband has landed a permanent position. It's a lot to take in at the moment, but I decided to let myself get over the guilt and that it was okay to share some happiness. So this is me celebrating a win :-)

,povertyfinance,"So I had a temporary factory job that I sucked butthole at and would cry at a lot thinking about the wrong choices I made in life to end up there. Naturally, most employers do not like this and let you go after the third time of doing this.

I have a part time job as a home health aide but have just started it so it's going to be a second before I get a paycheck from it and it's not going to be very big. I like this job, but I wouldn't be paid enough if I went full time to pay all my bills.

I need a job that pays at least $10 an hour. I have therapy in the mornings so I'd like either a second or third shift job because of that. That's why working in a factory was appealing to me; you have options when it comes to different shifts. I'd also like to keep my home health aide job because I like my clients and I need a second job in general to pay off debt from going to school and not having good enough credit to get a Sallie Mae loan by myself. I'd also like to get another car in the next year because mine is probably going to blow up soon and driving an Impala with doors that don't shut isn't fun, so keeping this second job is my preferable choice.

I do pay rent to my mom. I have a phone bill. I have pets (two cats, two rats, and a rabbit) to feed and I'm running out of cat food and need fresh vegetables to feed the ~~heathens~~ lagomorph and the rodents. I have student loans to pay. I have a debt in collections. I do not have a car payment but I have insurance. I have a Klarna bill about to go to collections for $100. Actually, most of these bills are around $100. I am not sure how to tell my mom I lost a job for being shitty at it. I want to not exist because existing is expensive. I haven't taken my medications because they have me on five different ones and \*that's $50, Batman!\*

I'm stressed. I don't know what to do next. I'm thinking bad thoughts and crying to Brand New songs while driving to my clients' houses. I feel like this is the part of the movie where all the bad things happen to me at once but life isn't a movie and this feels like it's never going to get better. I feel like I'm never going back to school. I'm so depressed about everything and it sucks. Everything sucks.

Walk into a dealership dressed in nice clothes and tell them you wish to buy a brand new $60,000 luxury car.

I am starting to do this immediately, no more wasted pizza for me. Do the following: 

\- Find a sharp edge of a counter or sturdy table and have the middle of the pizza aimed at the edge. 

\- Hit the pizza against the edge so it separates equally (don't worry, the plastic wrap should stay in tact so pizza toppings don't go flying everywhere 

\- Cut the plastic wrap along where the pizza is divided along with the paper with the brand logo on it 

\- Cut the cardboard evenly where the pizza is divided 

\- Take some plastic wrap and wrap the divided pizza pieces very tightly with wren plastic wrap 

No more wasted pizza (or wasted money). This is great especially if your workplace has pizza ovens.

,povertyfinance,"&gt;U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced approval for  Arizona and California’s request to provide online purchasing of food  to SNAP Households in the States of Arizona and California. This  approval will allow the states to expedite the implementation of online  purchasing with currently authorized SNAP online retailers with a target  start date later this month.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The [SNAP online pilot](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot)  is currently operational in Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Oregon,  and Washington State. Nebraska joined the pilot on April 1, 2020.  Maryland and New Jersey remain non‐operational pilot states. The  authorized retailers working with all pilot states are Amazon and  Walmart, while Wrights Market and ShopRite are working with Alabama and  New York respectively. Dash’s Market, Fresh Direct, Hy‐Vee, and Safeway  are authorized retailers, which are not currently operational.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Though the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition  Service (FNS) is receiving interest to expand the SNAP online pilot  program, the responsibility is on state agencies, their third-party  processor, and any retailers who wish to participate. To ease the  process, FNS put together a simplified template for states who wish to  enter the online pilot which is provided as an attachment to this  letter.

I don't know where to find the attachment that is the template for states.

I do know that it's imperative that anyone receiving SNAP in states that aren't currently on the list of online purchasing to contact your state elected officials to urge them to implement this capability ASAP.

Not only because of coronavirus, but for always.

I opened a Wells Fargo credit card back in July 2014 with a $3000 limit.  I lost my job and ran the balance up to $3800 with all the interest before the account was closed by Wells Fargo and charged off.  It’s currently still on my report as a negative account and it shows that it will stay on record until Jan 2023.  

My FICO score from Discover Credit Scorecard is 552.  However my score is 670 on Credit Karma and 675 on NerdWallet. 

I opened a Secured Discover IT card and Secured Capital One card back in September of 2019 and have kept my credit utilization very low and the balances paid off.   Having these has improved my scores in credit karma and NerdWallet but hasn’t done much for my FICO.  

Those three accounts are pretty much the extent of my current credit reports.  2 open in good standing and the 1 Wells Fargo closed account that is charged off. 

My question is what else should I be doing to help my scores, especially the FICO.  I want to purchase a car sometime soon.   

How should I best handle the charge off at this point in time?  Should I try and pay it down with the CA or maybe request a Payment for Deletion from my report?  Or am I just basically screwed until Jan 2023?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

Basically the title; our situation is apparently complicated but I'll keep this short and simple. Basically we live in an apartment, me, girlfriend, and our friend. Friend qualifies for CERB but is waiting to hear back from her OW worker about it, me and gf do not qualify. Two of us are at high risk and I'm on disability. We're not sure how to keep up with rent, Roger's, credit payments, and food (all three of us have special dietary requirements due to allergies or pre existing conditions). Are there any other resources or advice anyone can give? 

So far, we're budgeting the best we can but are struggling to adjust to price increases, stock availability, and delivery fees; we come up in the red consistently and so far have cut the Roger's bill. My credit score is only around 500 something because for some reason it's dropped nearly 200 points in 6 months despite no changes, fraud, or missed payments that I can find. We've all already applied for increased limits, new cards, and deferred payments. 

We've also called just about all our local employment agencies, support services, government supports, anything we can think of.

So far people are saying we cant be evicted if we cakt pay rent, Roger's can't cut us off for lissed payments either. However they still accrue and we're concerned what happens when this is over and we have tens of thousands in rent and Roger's bills payments.  

So all in all, does anyone have any advice, resources, or info?

,povertyfinance,"I joined reddit so I could post this. I don't know if this is the appropriate place for it, but I don't know where else to say it., and I'm just hoping for some shared experiences. If you're still struggling to get out of poverty, maybe don't read this, I don't know. It's not super encouraging. I guess I can tell you that it IS possible, but not much more.

I have some serious Irish luck.

I grew up in poverty, in a poverty stricken place, with poverty stricken people. 

Now, I have a degree and a solid job, and even insurance and shit. Y'all, I have benefits. Fucking BENEFITS, what even does that mean. I live in fucking Santa Barbara. I have escaped from the blackhole that is low-income hometowns. I have a lot to say about The Shit That People Don't Tell You when you try to get out of poverty, but I'll save most of them for another time. Right now I just need to talk about the randomness of getting out of poverty. 

I will say that mostly I really do my best to fully appreciate he life I have been fortunate enough to acquire. I'm not rich, by any means, but I'm doing well and comfortable and living a happy life.

But every now and then I'm really struck by that feeling of fully appreciating how much of a crapshoot life is, and how much dumb luck got me where I am. People try to spout this shit about America being the land of opportunity and how you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but if you grew up poor (and you're honest with yourself) you know that that's bullshit. I absolutely did work hard, but I know other people who also worked just as hard as me but maybe had one or two more setbacks than I did and ended up absolutely fucked. I worked hard, but I also spent long periods of time being kinda selfish and choosing to focus on classes instead of opting to work more, to financially help my family. You can argue that I'm in more of a place to help them now, but they won't ask for it now, because I have set that precedent. I was unlucky in being poor and female, and after I got to college I fully appreciated how much disparity there is between what I had and what other people have and don't even realize is a privilege. But I was also exceptionally lucky in being white, and from a family who spoke in a way that society considers to be ""proper"" and who encouraged higher education, even though nobody else had anything to speak of. 

You may have heard the term ""Irish luck"" before, but most people misinterpret it. It doesn't mean luck as in good fortune. Irish luck is when things are absolute shit until that very last moment at which everything seems absolutely hopeless, but at the last moment things kind of work out out by some miraculous fortune, some random event that saves your ass when you thought for sure \*this\* one was the time you'd be done for. THAT is Irish luck. And that is all that stands between any poor person and moderate prosperity. Fucking Irish luck

In a lot of senses, I've ""made it."" But I have no illusions that I did anything in particular to deserve this. 

All I have is guilt over being okay when so many other people aren't, just because they had one less good turn of luck than I did. And honestly, it fucks me up to think about. I volunteer with homeless families and donate money where I can, and try to help get my brother and sisters out of that hell hole, but it never feels like enough.

I don&amp;#39;t know if this is the appropriate place for it, but I don&amp;#39;t know where else to say it., and I&amp;#39;m just hoping for some shared experiences. If you&amp;#39;re still struggling to get out of poverty, maybe don&amp;#39;t read this, I don&amp;#39;t know. It&amp;#39;s not super encouraging. I guess I can tell you that it IS possible, but not much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some serious Irish luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in poverty, in a poverty stricken place, with poverty stricken people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a degree and a solid job, and even insurance and shit. Y&amp;#39;all, I have benefits. Fucking BENEFITS, what even does that mean. I live in fucking Santa Barbara. I have escaped from the blackhole that is low-income hometowns. I have a lot to say about The Shit That People Don&amp;#39;t Tell You when you try to get out of poverty, but I&amp;#39;ll save most of them for another time. Right now I just need to talk about the randomness of getting out of poverty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say that mostly I really do my best to fully appreciate he life I have been fortunate enough to acquire. I&amp;#39;m not rich, by any means, but I&amp;#39;m doing well and comfortable and living a happy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every now and then I&amp;#39;m really struck by that feeling of fully appreciating how much of a crapshoot life is, and how much dumb luck got me where I am. People try to spout this shit about America being the land of opportunity and how you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but if you grew up poor (and you&amp;#39;re honest with yourself) you know that that&amp;#39;s bullshit. I absolutely did work hard, but I know other people who also worked just as hard as me but maybe had one or two more setbacks than I did and ended up absolutely fucked. I worked hard, but I also spent long periods of time being kinda selfish and choosing to focus on classes instead of opting to work more, to financially help my family. You can argue that I&amp;#39;m in more of a place to help them now, but they won&amp;#39;t ask for it now, because I have set that precedent. I was unlucky in being poor and female, and after I got to college I fully appreciated how much disparity there is between what I had and what other people have and don&amp;#39;t even realize is a privilege.

The price of a new car as well as the prices of used cars keep going up. The $300 car is long gone. More and more people have to finance their car as a result. Some with high interest, like 20%.

They have loans for all sorts of things you can't afford, dentures, weddings, etc. Even when you die, your spouse or other person can get a ""funeral loan"".

Housing is in high demand and more and more houses get bought up and rented out, which only drives up the price, and only makes it harder to afford.

,povertyfinance,"**Beware of Booking.com, please heed this warning of traveling with them in the future. I had $719 taken from me.** 

I am going to outline my attempts to remedy my situation, step by step. All of which were unsuccessful. This has resulted in me deep in debt, with no options left as I am now unemployed due to COVID19.

On February 13th, I booked this property in Portland to visit the city and attend my Sister's wedding.

* Link to the property here: 
[http://www.booking.com/Share-9BNBJL](http://www.booking.com/Share-9BNBJL)

* Screenshot of the property here: 
[https://i.imgur.com/3yKrNlw.png](https://i.imgur.com/3yKrNlw.png)

The check-in date of my booking was for a duration of 3 nights, April 8th to April 11th. 
The cost of the three-night stay was going to $469, with specific terms for payment.

30% was supposed to be collected immediately- $140.96

The remaining amount collected 30 days before check-in - $328.91

And finally a refundable “security deposit” taken 14 days prior - $250

To outline this specific payment schedule, see the following details:

1. February 13th: $140.96
1. March 9th: $328.91
1. March 25th: $250.00 (refundable)

I booked the apartment, knowing full well I could meet this payment structure, I had the $140 ready to pay. I accepted the payment schedule, clicked book, and then Booking.com sent me an email confirmation, specifically detailing those exact payment terms, 30% today, 70% before 30 days, etc...

Screenshot of the email receipt from Booking.com: [https://i.imgur.com/HY1lsQ8.png](https://i.imgur.com/HY1lsQ8.png)

And then I got a separate email receipt from **Pelican Stay Executive Suites**.

**They took $719.88 on February 13th.** 

* Screenshot of my receipt from Pelican Stay Executive suites, dated February 13: [https://i.imgur.com/7p0QXYG.png](https://i.imgur.com/7p0QXYG.png)

**$719.88**

Immediately I noticed the charge and responded via email.

* Screenshot of my email to Pelican Stay Executive Suites: [https://i.imgur.com/bVFaDkT.png](https://i.imgur.com/bVFaDkT.png)

I didn't receive a response, so I freaked out and called them. 
Why on earth was I charged so much money immediately? I told them they made a mistake, it was only supposed to be a $140 charge.. **I can’t afford to pay that much today**, I spoke to a man named Charlie and he recognized the error and told me “the accounting department has been notified to issue the refund in the overcharge” and that was after spending over an hour on the phone. 

**But the refund never came.** 

When I asked them where the refund on the overcharge response is? ""The accounting department has been notified""

* Screenshot of mentioning ""the accounting department"": [https://i.imgur.com/uAzD9Ck.png](https://i.imgur.com/uAzD9Ck.png)

Booking.com has a specific function where the guest can request a free cancellation, allowing the property to agree or disagree. 

Using this method, I requested a free cancellation and a refund of the entire amount, because they did not follow the payment agreement, so the registration was void because of it. **They had clearly violated the payment terms, and the payment collection schedule that was advertised to me.** They told me no. The “cancellation policy” was a firm cancellation fee, even for booking within 24 hours. 

* Screenshot of Pelican Stay denial of free cancellation: [https://i.imgur.com/b1nXUFN.png](https://i.imgur.com/b1nXUFN.png)

I was furious! The property did absolutely nothing to help me, I'm now in debt $719, so I turned to Booking.com for help. Their solution? They contact the property directly, the property told them the same thing. Cancel for a steep cancellation fee, or that’s it. 

* Screenshot of Booking.com receiving the free cancellation rejection: [https://i.imgur.com/wCutdm7.png](https://i.imgur.com/wCutdm7.png)

Over the phone the Booking.com representative told me point-blank: **We know they overcharged you, and they broke the payment terms, but the cancellation policy is set by the property, there is nothing we can do.** 

I sent emails, I made hour-long phone calls, I disputed the transaction with my bank(it was rejected) and this torment went on for months!!!! 

* Screenshot of dispute rejection from Chase Bank: [https://i.imgur.com/O9ZiBqU.png](https://i.imgur.com/O9ZiBqU.png)

**And the cherry on top? COVID-19 canceled the wedding in Portland, I’m not even supposed to go.** 

The properties response to COVID19 when I call and ask for my money back? “**We are still open, you agreed to pay us**”

And Booking.com’s response to me when I mention COVID19? 
“The cancellation policy is set by the property. There is nothing we can do.”

* Screenshot of Booking.com support's response to me: [https://i.imgur.com/mqYPZzV.png](https://i.imgur.com/mqYPZzV.png)

Hilariously, I asked the support rep if COVID19 has affected her area... “Yes, we are working from home due to shelter in place”.

Can you imagine the irony? The company that's is forcing me to pay for a hotel room which overcharged me, at a city affected by COVID19 has all its employees work from home....

Well I was done. **I have been deep in debt since February 13th, now I am unemployed due to COVID19**, and completely broken because of this scam. I am done.

I had $719 taken from me.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to outline my attempts to remedy my situation, step by step. All of which were unsuccessful. This has resulted in me deep in debt, with no options left as I am now unemployed due to COVID19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 13th, I booked this property in Portland to visit the city and attend my Sister&amp;#39;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to the property here: 
&lt;a href=""http://www.booking.com/Share-9BNBJL""&gt;http://www.booking.com/Share-9BNBJL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of the property here: 
&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/3yKrNlw.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/3yKrNlw.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The check-in date of my booking was for a duration of 3 nights, April 8th to April 11th. 
The cost of the three-night stay was going to $469, with specific terms for payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30% was supposed to be collected immediately- $140.96&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining amount collected 30 days before check-in - $328.91&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally a refundable “security deposit” taken 14 days prior - $250&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To outline this specific payment schedule, see the following details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February 13th: $140.96&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 9th: $328.91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 25th: $250.00 (refundable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked the apartment, knowing full well I could meet this payment structure, I had the $140 ready to pay. I accepted the payment schedule, clicked book, and then Booking.com sent me an email confirmation, specifically detailing those exact payment terms, 30% today, 70% before 30 days, etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of the email receipt from Booking.com: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/HY1lsQ8.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/HY1lsQ8.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I got a separate email receipt from &lt;strong&gt;Pelican Stay Executive Suites&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They took $719.88 on February 13th.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$719.88&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately I noticed the charge and responded via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshot of my email to Pelican Stay Executive Suites: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/bVFaDkT.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/bVFaDkT.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t receive a response, so I freaked out and called them. 
Why on earth was I charged so much money immediately? I told them they made a mistake, it was only supposed to be a $140 charge.. &lt;strong&gt;I can’t afford to pay that much today&lt;/strong&gt;, I spoke to a man named Charlie and he recognized the error and told me “the accounting department has been notified to issue the refund in the overcharge” and that was after spending over an hour on the phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the refund never came.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked them where the refund on the overcharge response is? &amp;quot;The accounting department has been notified&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of mentioning &amp;quot;the accounting department&amp;quot;: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/uAzD9Ck.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/uAzD9Ck.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Accounting department&amp;quot; : &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Ll1PRgb.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/Ll1PRgb.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accounting team: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/goOtZt4.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/goOtZt4.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booking.com has a specific function where the guest can request a free cancellation, allowing the property to agree or disagree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method, I requested a free cancellation and a refund of the entire amount, because they did not follow the payment agreement, so the registration was void because of it. &lt;strong&gt;They had clearly violated the payment terms, and the payment collection schedule that was advertised to me.&lt;/strong&gt; They told me no. The “cancellation policy” was a firm cancellation fee, even for booking within 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshot of Pelican Stay denial of free cancellation: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/b1nXUFN.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/b1nXUFN.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was furious! The property did absolutely nothing to help me, I&amp;#39;m now in debt $719, so I turned to Booking.com for help. Their solution? They contact the property directly, the property told them the same thing. Cancel for a steep cancellation fee, or that’s it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshot of Booking.com receiving the free cancellation rejection: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/wCutdm7.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/wCutdm7.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the phone the Booking.com representative told me point-blank: &lt;strong&gt;We know they overcharged you, and they broke the payment terms, but the cancellation policy is set by the property, there is nothing we can do.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent emails, I made hour-long phone calls, I disputed the transaction with my bank(it was rejected) and this torment went on for months!!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshot of dispute rejection from Chase Bank: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/O9ZiBqU.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/O9ZiBqU.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the cherry on top? COVID-19 canceled the wedding in Portland, I’m not even supposed to go.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The properties response to COVID19 when I call and ask for my money back? “&lt;strong&gt;We are still open, you agreed to pay us&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Booking.com’s response to me when I mention COVID19? 
“The cancellation policy is set by the property. There is nothing we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know if I am allowed to self refer to specialists on Medicaid or do I need to go through my pcp?

,povertyfinance,"Hi guys,

I have a friend who was recently laid off from her job. Luckily her lease is close to ending. I am offering her a rent free room at my place.

I have a question though. I know that some states are prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants for 90 days, and some banks are deferring mortgages.

When the 90 days are up, will the tenants need to come up with those tree months payments to avoid being evicted ? Will home owners be responsible for 3 months of mortgage payments (if the payments were not pushed to the end of the loan.)

I am curious because, it seems like people will still be screwed in a few months- if so.

,povertyfinance,"Is it a good time to withdraw money from overseas banks right now? (Commonwealth Bank Australia - Development Bank of Singapore)

Some context: I opened an account with CBA while I was on a semester’s exchange last year (to facilitate payment of accommodation/ misc fees). I’m now back from my exchange (in Singapore) and had initially left the account open because I was planning to return this year for postgraduate studies / working holiday. My visa’s settled and all, but looking at the situation now I won’t be able to return any time soon. 

I’m also a little low on money now since I was dismissed from my part time job, and still have a couple of months to go until my official graduation when i (hopefully) will begin full time employment. 

Would it be a good idea to transfer funds from CBA (in AUD) to my Singaporean bank account (DBS)? I have about AUD900 in the CBA account, and it’s not much, but I’m hoping to be able to access those funds when necessary. Alternatively, should I just keep the money in the account until it’s absolutely necessary?

* free version of Mint has ads
* Mint will send you a lot of emails
* Mint and YNAB are not perfect. With a spreadsheet you can customize it to your liking

With the federal stimulus coming in to effect with a bonus $600 a week. Would I be ineligible to recieve benefits because of working? If so it seems it would be more beneficial to not work and receive unemployment.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I filed and it was accepted with no problems. Some questions were a little confusing though. Good luck to everyone, especially if they said you have to call! I heard the phone lines aren&amp;#39;t going through...&lt;/p&gt;
