,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,0,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,274,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,274,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

It appears that Tesla sales in China are hurting both from the market share of EVs generally but also from being overtaken by local companies like BYD, which sold more EVs than Tesla.


This weakness seems pretty troubling considering Tesla's commitments to pay $323 million starting in 2023 to maintain their Shanghai factory lease. Meanwhile, Tesla had to drop prices to get below subsidy thresholds and China plans to drop the ceiling another 20% next year.

,investing,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/11/coronavirus-fda-grants-emergency-use-authorization-abbott-labs-antibody-test.html

&gt;The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories’ new coronavirus test that detects Covid-19 antibodies, the company announced Monday.
Abbott said it plans to ship nearly 30 million tests this month and will have the capacity to ship 60 million tests in June. 
The tests can indicate whether a person has had Covid-19 and was either asymptomatic or recovered.

&gt;“Having more options of highly reliable tests across our platforms will help healthcare workers and health officials as they conduct broad scale testing for Covid-19,” Abbott CEO Robert Ford said in a statement.
The authorization means laboratories will be allowed to use the test even though it has not been formally approved or cleared by the FDA.
U.S. officials and corporations across America are pouring money into antibody testing, hoping it will give people the confidence to return to work and reopen parts of the economy. President Donald Trump has recommended states use the tests as they start relaxing some of the strict social distancing measures imposed to combat the pandemic, which has infected more than 1.3 million people across the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. 

&gt;Last week, the FDA tightened rules for coronavirus antibody tests, ordering manufacturers to submit emergency use authorization forms within 10 days.
Since the FDA issued its initial antibody test policy in mid-March, the agency said it has become aware of “a concerning number” of commercial serology tests being promoted inappropriately, including for diagnostic use, or performing poorly.

&gt;This is Abbott’s fourth Covid-19 test to win emergency use authorization. Abbott had already launched three coronavirus tests in the United States, including a rapid test that produces results in as little as five minutes and the newly released test that shows if a person has antibodies against the virus.
The company announced last month that it was working with CVS Health to get its tests “outside of the hospital” and into places like urgent-care clinics and nursing homes.

&gt;Abbott said the new test is more efficient and can provide more tests and take up less space, an important feature the company said for labs that process tens of thousands of patient samples but are often short on space.
It can exclude false positives 99.6% of the time and exclude false negatives 100% of the time for patients tested 14 days after symptoms began, the company said Monday.
It plans to submit for European CE mark approval this week.

,investing,"**Context:**

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater and quite a big name in the investment community, is currently writing a new book. In this book, he describes the rise and fall of empires and tries to model archetypical sequences of such events.

He is currently releasing chapters for free outlining the study and giving an introduction to the topic and some context to the important concepts he will later use. ([Link to articles](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/))

In the latest article, he is explaining the debt cycles and how they work.   


Short-term deb cycle: smaller economic expansions and contractions which typically last around 8 years.

Long-term debt cycle: big economic contractions and debt-restructuring like the great depression.

Video made by him explaining this much more eloquently than I ever could: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

**Main point:**

Reading through the article I stumbled upon this gem about when the long-term debt cycle is ending:

&gt;More specifically, the ability of central banks to be stimulative ends when the central bank loses its ability to produce money and credit growth that pass through the economic system to produce real economic growth.  

This is very much in line with what we are seeing right now. Asset prices go up but the economy is not really ""stimulated"".

If you keep selling shares, you'll eventually run out of shares. But you won't run out of dividends because you still have the same amount of shares (assuming dividends aren't cut obviously).

The whole point of not being too focused on dividends is because you could theoretically generate more returns through stock appreciation, for various reasons.

I live in Southern California

Single as of now (meaning; no one to go in on property with)

Live at home and saving, looking to move out within the next few years.

Take home $2300 every 2 weeks = ~60k a year after taxes 

I've worked at the aforementioned job for 7 months and saved 17k (I paid off 10k in loans also and now debt free)

1) use current and future savings (within a year) to outright buy a house out of state and rent out and become a slumlord 

Or 

2) continue saving for 3 to 4 more years and afford a house to live in of my own


Essentially it comes down to: use savings to buy rental property and use rental income to supplement my own or keep saving and eventually buy place of my own locally.


3rd bonus option is to buy a local duplex/triplex and live in 1 unit and rent out the other(s) until able to move out.

I have been browsing this subreddit and many others and often come across many posts or comments advising to buy bitcoin, gold, or other assets which are seen as store of value investments. While we often feel our time is unique, it is important to remember that there is rarely a situation we come across which does not allow lessons from the past. As such, I strongly encourage you to consider the below arguments put forward by Benjamin Graham in his book The Intelligent Investor. 

Why should you care what some dead investor from the 70’s thinks about our current situation? The intelligent investor is often considered the greatest book on investment ever written. It is Wareen Buffet’s (former richest man on earth) favorite book and has yet to be proven wrong through over 50 years of investments. I strongly encourage anyone who has not read this book but wants to invest and build their own wealth to read it cover to cover.

Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges

The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust their currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against the law for American citizens since 1935–luckily for them. In the past 35 years the price of gold in the open market has advanced from $35 an ounce to $48 in early 1972–a rise of only 35%. But during all this time the holder of gold has received no income return on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done better with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in the general price level.

The near-complete failure of hold to protect against a loss in the purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the ability of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by putting his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable objects have had striking advances in market value over the years—such as diamonds, paintings by masters, first editions of books, rare stamps, and counts, etc. But in many, perhaps most, of these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the precarious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is hard to think of paying $67,500 for a US silver dollar dated 1804 (but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.” We acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.

The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount of protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles. Finally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate means, except by various types of participation’s with others and with the special hazards that attach to new flotations— not too different from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All we should say to the investor is, “be sure it is yours before you go into it.”

,investing,"I've seen a lot of posts about how the market is too high and it doesn't make sense.  Here are some perspectives for why things are bad and should be down from January, but also why things aren't so bad that we should be at 2008 levels.

1.  About 75% of new unemployment is expected to be temporary.  This puts true unemployment levels at numbers that are obviously bad, but not 2008 level bad.
2.  Interest rates are at all time lows.  If you've taken a corporate finance class this would help explain the risk premium.  Assume most people see stocks as requiring an additional 5% return above the risk free rate.  If the risk free rate drops from 3% to 1%, your expected return from stocks drops from 8% to 6%.  When this happens, the price of stocks go up and not down.  To explain this, assume we have a company that only pays out 100% of profits as dividends.  Under the old normal, you'd pay $100 for a stock and expect $8 in dividends every year (an 8% return).  Now the question is, how much would you pay for the same stock if it earns -$8 this year and $8 per year after that, but you now demand only a 6% return.  The formula becomes $8 in perpetuity minus the immediate change for this year of $16 or $8/.06 - $16 = $117.33.  Obviously, these are made up numbers to illustrate a point.  That point is, prices go up when interest rates go down.  If you want to make the formula more complex, assume low interest rates for 5 years then back to the higher level after that, which may be more representative of the current environment.
3.  The Fed is backstopping everything.  What this essentially means is that the money printing machine in America is issuing loans.  If these loans are paid back, then the Fed will earn money on its investment and we will have deflation.  However, the Fed can simply print more money to help avoid deflation.  The other side of this equation, would be that the Fed invests poorly and loses money.  Now, we instead have inflation which the Fed can then stop printing money to a certain extent.  Assuming they lose grip and inflation becomes quite high, this is also good for most stocks, especially in a nominal sense.  Stocks are generally a decent inflation hedge, not the best, but decent.
4.  Government debt is also hitting new highs.  However, we are literally issuing debt at a rate lower than our targeted inflation number.  Of course the government could spend it in ways that do not contribute to the economy at all.  However, they need to do the bare minimum to provide out performance relative to the rates they will borrow at.
5.  Due to the combination of 3 and 4 above, it is unlikely there will be a massive liquidity issue.  These are where the market crashes really come into play.  If there is no one to provide money to people, then investors start demanding very high risk premiums because money becomes very high demand.  This would influence number 2 in the opposite direction and make stocks go down.  All in all, I believe a liquidity scenario is possible but very unlikely, which is why I advocate for at least putting a majority of your cash in the market instead of waiting for a pullback.  However, hold a little cash in case there is a larger market issue.
6.  Larger businesses represent a majority of the publicly traded companies.  However, small businesses are hurt the most from the current crisis.

,investing,"Yesterday I  listened to this very interesting podcast ( We Study Billionaires - TIP295: Mohnish Pabrai on Value Investing &amp; Philanthropy) where Mohnish Pabrai mentions what he calls secret compounders. The concept sounds very interesting to me, the company that compounds earnings like Visa or Mastercard, but doesn't demand the premium yet, since market doesn't know it yet. He mentions his investment in Fiat - Chrysler (FCAU) where he thought that Ferrari (RACE) alone is worth the whole company due to this reason. I have been thinking about it since yesterday, but I couldn't think of any. I also tried to identify some requirements for such a company.

1. Low P/E: goal is obviously to find the ones that haven't appreciated in value yet, since Mr. Market doesn't know about or doesn't value their compounding ability yet. So they have to have earnings and P/E multiple growth potential. If they have high P/E I can just buy V or MA, where I am sure of their copounding ability.
2. Addresable market that they dominate and is also growing, enabling the future growth of the company.
3. High operating and net margin that signal strong moat and ability to earn a lot of money which they then reinvest in the bussines.
4. Scalability without increasing costs; costs percentage should be decreasing considerably with scale. Something like Saas is the best representation of this.
5. Reinvested earnings are effective at raising revenue. If company is just investing a lot of money, but there is no growth, then they lack compounding ability imo (like IBM for example).

These are just a few points that I am not even sure that apply so I would like to get your opinion.

What criteria should we use to figure our if the company is a secret compunder? And do you have any ideas which companies would that be and why?

To me, the closest I could think of is Cisco (CSCO). They generate huge cash flow, have great balance sheet and pay nice and sustainable dividend. However, this doesn't make them a compunder, but just a nice company to invest in. Their shift from legacy business to Saas could make them one, but only if they are successful in making it a larger part of their revenue. This would increase their earnings power and also make their revenue more predictable, warranting P/E multiple expansion.

,investing,"Last week, we initiated a position in Springworks Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SWTX), and as promised, we’re providing our view on the company. 

**Summary:** Founded in 2017, Springworks is a $1.4B market cap biotech company developing targeted oncology therapies for rare tumor types with high unmet need. We like Springworks for several key reasons: 

* The company has two late-stage (Phase 2/3) programs, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, targeting rare tumor types with high unmet need (either insufficient therapies or no available therapies). Past trial data gives us confidence in their chances of approval, and we expect these candidates to be approved in 2022 and 2023 respectively, upon which they will become first-in-class drugs in their respective indications through their differentiated clinical profiles. 
* Springworks has signed collaborations with major biotech companies to develop several interesting early stage assets in additional oncology indications, providing a degree of validation of Springworks’ assets and creating a future growth runway. 
* We anticipate several value-creating milestones over the next year, namely topline data from nirogacestat’s registrational Phase 3 trial in mid-2021 and an interim update from mirdametinib’s registrational Phase 2b in 1Q21. 
* Our DCF analysis assigns Springworks a price target of $55, assuming an 85% probability of success for nirogacestat and mirdametinib in their main indications, and using an 11% discount rate and 2% terminal growth rate. 

**Company Background:** Springworks was established in 2017 as a spinoff from Pfizer, which provided the company with initial funding and the development rights to its 4 clinical assets. Springworks raised \~$230M from investors including Bain Capital and OrbiMed Advisors before going public in September 2019. 

**1. Late-stage Clinical Programs in Areas of High Unmet Need:** Springworks has two late stage programs currently in registrational or potentially registrational trials:

Nirogacestat. Nirogacestat is an oral, selective gamma secretase inhibitor developed to treat desmoid tumors. 

* *Desmoid tumors.* Desmoid tumors are highly morbid, soft tissue tumors with an estimated 6,000 patients being treated in the US every year. 
* *Unmet need.* Though survival rates for desmoid tumors are relatively high compared to other cancer types, desmoid tumors place a heavy burden on patients’ quality of life; they can interfere with the function of nearby structures (e.g. intestines), are painful to live with, and highly disfiguring. Treatment has traditionally been via surgical resection, but this method has been associated with recurrence rates of up to 70%. Chemotherapy and other targeted cancer therapies have been used off-label as well, but these have shown inconsistent efficacy and unfavorable safety profiles. 
* Nirogacestat has received FDA breakthrough and orphan drug designation.

Mirdametinib. Mirdametinib is an oral, selective MEK inhibitor developed to treat NF1-associate plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). 

* *NF1-PN.* The NF1 gene produces neurofibromin, a protein that represses a key signaling pathway (RAS/MAPK) responsible for the growth of many cancers. When the NF1 gene is mutated, the loss of neurofibromin production allows this pathway to run unchecked, resulting in tumor growth across the body. There are \~100k NF1 patients in the US, and 30-50% of these patients can develop plexiform neurofibromas, which are tumors that grow along nerves. 
* *Unmet need.* NF1-PN are associated with extreme pain and disfigurement as well as interference with neurocognitive function. First-line therapy is usually surgical resection, but NF1-PN extensive growth patterns along nerves make them hard to completely remove (while risking nerve damage). 
* There is one approved MEK inhibitor for NF1-PN, AstaZeneca’s selumetinib, which was approved in April 2020. While the drug works, mirdametinib has demonstrated a potentially superior safety profile vs. selumetinib, which should allow patients to remain on therapy longer and experience more clinical benefit. 
* Mirdametinib has received FDA orphan drug designation. 

**2. Promising Clinical Data.** 

Nirogacestat. To date, nirogacestat has shown a promising clinical profile in its Phase 1 and 2 trials. The drug is currently enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial, with progression free survival (PFS, a measure of how long patients live without their tumors growing &gt;20% in size) as the primary endpoint. 

* *Phase 1.* Nirogacestat achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 71.4% in its 7-patient Phase 1 trial (5/7), and a 100% disease control rate (DCR). Patients were able to stay on the drug for a median of 49.5 months (at the time of publication, so possibly longer), and none went off treatment due to safety issues. 
* *Phase 2.* In a heavily pre-treated population (median 4 lines of prior therapy vs. 3 in Phase 1 i.e. sicker patients), nirogacestat again achieved a 100% DCR and a 29.4% ORR. More importantly, 59% of patients remained on drug for more than 2 years. The drug was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to side effects. 
* *Phase 3.* A 115-patient Phase 3 trial is currently enrolling patients. The trial is powered to show a 12-month difference in PFS vs. placebo, and past trials from a similar drug showed that 50% of placebo patients experience disease progression by 8 months, which compares favorably to what nirogacestat has demonstrated in its Phase 1/2 trials. 
* The Phase 3 trial is expected to readout in 2Q/3Q21 and we expect approval of nirogacestat in 2022. 

Mirdametinib.  

* *Phase 2.* In its Phase 2 trial, Mirdametinib demonstrated a 42% ORR in 8/19 patients. In contrast, selumetinib demonstrated a 74% ORR in its Phase 2 trial. Though selumetinib’s Phase 2 data was numerically superior to mirdametinib’s, we believe several factors artificially limited mirdametinib’s efficacy:
   * Selumetinib’s trial enrolled only children while mirdametinib’s trial included only patients 16 years or older. Tumors in younger children are considered to be more responsive to therapy than those in adults. 
   * Patients in the mirdametinib trial were removed from the trial if they did not show signs of benefit within 12 months, which may have limited the number responses; 30% of selumetinib’s patients did not respond until after 12 months on drug. 
* *Safety benefits.* In its Phase 2, only 5 out of 19 patients (26%) required dose reductions of mirdametinib. In contrast, in selumetinib’s Phase 1, 10 out of 24 patients (42%) required dose reductions due to toxicity issues. We believe that this is evidence that mirdametinib is a safer drug than selumetinib, which will be an important differentiating factor for doctors deciding between the two drugs. 
* *Phase 2b.* Springworks is currently enrolling patients for a 100-patient Phase 2b trial of mirdametinib (primary endpoint ORR) that could support approval in 2023. The trial will enroll an even split of pediatric and adult patients and will not remove patients before 12 months. We expect that mirdametinib will show a similar ORR to selumetinib and differentiate itself via a superior safety profile. 

**3. Intriguing Early Stage Programs.**

* **Nirogacestat for Multiple Myeloma Therapy.** Nirogacestat is also being evaluated as an add-on therapy to BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells with \~27k patients in the US every year. These drugs target a protein called BCMA on the surface of cancer cells, and preclinical data has shown that nirogacestat significantly upregulates the expression of BCMA on cancer cells and enhanced the potency of BCMA-targeting drugs. Springworks has already signed collaborations with Glaxo Smith Kline and Allogene Therapeutics to use nirogacestat in combination trials with their BCMA drugs. 
* **BGB-3245.** Springworks has also signed a collaboration agreement with Beigene, a leading China biotech company, to develop a novel cancer drug targeting BRAF-mutant solid tumors. BRAF is a validated oncology target that is clinically relevant in melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. BGB-3245 has been shown in preclinical models to be effective in inhibiting certain mutant forms of BRAF that currently approved BRAF inhibitors cannot target. A Phase 1 trial for BGB-3245 has been initiated in Australia. 

**4. Strong Balance Sheet:** As of the end of 2019, Springworks had \~$330M in cash and no debt. This is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and support its 6 clinical trials through the end of 2022. The company has not indicated that its clinical development timelines have been impacted by Covid, but we will be on the lookout for any future guidance. 

**5. Experienced Leadership:** Springworks is led by a world-class management team with deep pharma industry experience. Selected leadership includes:

* Chief Executive Officer Saqib Islam is a founding member of the company and was formerly the Chief Business Officer at Moderna. Prior to Moderna, he held senior leadership roles at Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a $20B rare disease biotech).
* Chief Medical Officer Jens Renstrup was formerly Head of Medical Affairs at Alexion, where he was instrumental in building out its pipeline. Prior to Alexion, he led medical affairs at Glaxo Smith Kline’s vaccine division. 
* Head of R&amp;D Stephen Squinto is a venture partner at OrbiMed, a highly respected life science investment firm. He is also a co-founder of Alexion, where he led global operations and R&amp;D for over 20 years. 

**6. Risks.** Potential investors should be aware that Springworks is exposed to the following key risks as a biotech company:

* *Clinical development risk.* Springworks’ assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. 
* *Competitive risk.* Springworks’ drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. 
* *Financial risk.* Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down.

&lt;p&gt;Money can be printed to save people from poverty, and avoiding World War III  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From another side, those who keep cash are losing, being diluted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with this amount of money printed already and even more will be printed soon, I think the better investments are gold and Nasdaq. The entertainment money instead of flights, hotels, restaurants, sports events etc. flows into netflix, internet media, computer hardware and software, and even medicine research with is also in Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

The rest was in the form of Fed printing and unforgivable loans. This was to offset the capital flight to safe havens like cash and treasuries and restore liquidity to bond markets.

,investing,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

&lt;p&gt;At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency&amp;#39;s decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At midnight, Shah got the devastating news: he owed Interactive Brokers $9 million. He’d started the day with $77,000 in his account.&lt;/p&gt;

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■",t2_dy94bdh,False,,0,False,"A dangerous gap: The market v the real economy — The Economist, May 7 2020 edn.",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_gfpask,False,dark,0.92,,public,318,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,318,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588955534.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pasted &lt;a href=""https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/05/07/the-market-v-the-real-economy""&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt;, to exempt you from registering an account to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hello everybody, I want to start of by telling you that this is a really long post and I don't expect anyone to take from their personal time to read it. With that being said the structure is at follows - a short summary is the first thing that you will read. You can find the arguments in the body of the post if you are curious. Thank you for your attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Why we won't see a new low in the stock market
* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction
* How to **not** make a buying decision
* Why covid is not that horrible

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**

Will start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.

We will not see a new low due to a plethora of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.

The market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment.  The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.

We will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.

We will see companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T push higher due to 5G implementation.

We are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.

And so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**

&amp;#x200B;

Here we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.

Going with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.

The majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.

The news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.

Inflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.

China trade war. If Trump cancels the agreement we are going to see a reaction for sure in the market, the only question remaining is how bad?

&amp;#x200B;

**3. How to not make a buying decision**

&amp;#x200B;

Do not base you decision of buying a company, or anything for that matter on what some random persons says on reddit. Never! Even if that person is a super expert and he wants all the good in the world for you, once you buy something that you, personal have no clue about its going to be a source of anxiety because you don't know what happens. Its not worth it.

Do not buy just because FOMO (fear of missing out) - if you do not feel comfortable with the price before you buy, you will definitely not be comfortable after. Just be calm, controlled, do you research, make up your mind about a price, wait for it.

Do your due diligence. No matter the company. You want to buy Apple? Check their balance sheet, check their prospects, look at their future. Ask yourself questions: Will people need this company in 10 years? Will people still buy their products? Can they adapt to new markets? Can they grow their business? Make a list before looking at any company with the things that you care about, note your responses before investigating and then see if its a right fit for you.

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Why covid is not that horrible?**

Ah.. the downvoter topic. I was thinking not tackling this one but, whatever.. my opinion.

I want to start out by looking at Sweden. Do not start comparing the total numbers with the US because that is ridiculous, their population is much smaller.  Start comparing the per million numbers, there things get interesting: Deaths per million: 319 (USA is at 242), Cases per million: 2567 (USA has 4070), test per million: 14704 (USA has 26943). You can see the similarities. They have half the cases but also half the testing power so we can make an educated assumption and put them close to USA.

Sweden measures when comparing with USA are zero. They have very limited measures in place yet the case numbers evolves really similar. This is a case as to why the country should open.

The death rate is 100% overblown. Recent studies in Europe but also in USA start showing that the rate of infection is 20 to 100 higher than the official numbers. Even if we go with the low number of 20, that would put USA cases at over 25 million. This again proves that Covid is not that bad as we expected.

The majority of people that died (over 90%) are people over 65 with underlying conditions. Healthy, young people are just not affected nearly as bad some predicted.

Do not interpret my words on this topic as taking in lightly. I am not. But in a healthy society we need to be able to debate both sides of the story and not only the one pushed in the media.

,investing,"I've got around 10K invested currently in a variety of stocks, but I recently found out about 'preferred shares' and I'm very confused even after an hour of reading up on it...  
For example, I have around $1000 in Enbridge stock (**TSE: ENB**) and it has around a 7.3% estimated dividend yield, whereas some preferred shares of Enbridge have a higher dividend yield (such as **TSE: ENB.PF.E**, which sits at around 9.7% dividend yield currently).

So my main question is, why wouldn't I just sell all my Enbridge shares and buy their preferred shares (like **TSE: ENB.PF.E**) instead?  
Are these higher risk in some way?  
Why do they not go up and down in the same way as the 'real' stock?  
Why do these preferred shares exist? (and why are there so many types?)  
What is the difference between these preferred shares? (like ENB.PF.A vs ENB.PF.E vs ENB.PF.G?)

I'm sorry if I don't know much, I'm only 23 and recently paid off my student loans so I'd like to invest while the market is down but I don't really know what I'm doing...

Here is what my stock portfolio currently looks like (not including the RRSP from my employer, which is around 8K in US Equity):

,investing," 

I'm trying to figure out what Options are actually for so I came to realize that a situation I am in might be the purpose behind why Options exist.

So I have money in sort of like a bond that will mature in a couple months and I want to buy a particular stock I think has a good chance of increasing during that time. Is the purpose of buying an option as intended such that I can pay a little bit of money now to buy a Call such that I can buy the stock at a later date closer to its current price rather than the higher price later on.

For instance I would make the expiry after the bond thing matures and I would put the strike price such that the strike price + the fees and cost of the option are lower than what I can expect the stock to be trading at in a couple months.

This seems like the sort of thing Options are intended to be for, but when it is explained it is usually explained in the context of speculating, never when the money you would use to buy is non-liquid. In this situation the Option is a hedge against the increasing value of the stock while the money you would use to buy it is locked away.

The other situation I think Options are working as intended rather than as mere tools of speculation is when companies give stock options to their employees that are discounted as a form of compensation. The reason the Option gives a price that is different than the actual price in this situation is intended precisely because it is meant to encourage the employee to spend some of their money to get a stock which is worth more than they spent and the difference is compensation for them working such that the instant gain they get upon buying the discounted stock is a bit like a paid salary in that they could sell it immediately after buying it for market value.

If we go into more speculation territory buying an option sort of allows you to ""own"" various stocks at various prices without actually spending the money on them such that you could actually own another stock with that money at the same time. If something happens during that time that makes it a good buy for the strike price you could sell the stock you actually own, use the option, and then if you want you could immediately sell the option bought stock at the market value and re-buy the stock you were holding originally, perhaps even buying more of it with the profit you made with the quick sell-hold-stock, buy-call-stock-at-strike-price, sell-call-stock-for-market-value, buy-original-hold-stock. You could even layer this with many more Options than just one such that you could simultaneously ""own"" all the stocks with the same money with the risk being that your call expires before you have a good time to use it. This gives a lot more diversity than an otherwise small amount of money could provide, not to mention that the only risk you take if the price of these stocks drops is you are out the price of the Option rather than the price of the stock, the issue is you have to keep track of all that information, but if an algorithm did this ... well let's just say I now understand that guy who wanted me to make an options trading algorithm back in university that I turned down doing because I didn't understand what the hell was going on.",t2_635erzg9,False,,0,False,Is this the sort of situation Options are for?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_gg82fe,False,dark,0.67,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589024366.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out what Options are actually for so I came to realize that a situation I am in might be the purpose behind why Options exist.&lt;/p&gt;

This question has been bugging me for years now and I do understand the reason they can be auditors, advisors, and investors all at once. Financial markets are extremely complex and Blackrock has the resources and abilities to tackle financial issues governments and companies have. I understand why they are chosen to fix those issues. But how are they allowed to act in all those roles that overlap?

I do understand the heads of Blackrock are also the founders and they genuinely seem to have a positive interest in society as they are willing to shift and adapt their investment and other business to a more progressive time - think how Dicks and other stores stopped selling guns. This was due to Blackrocks ability to shift market sentiment based on their philosophies. No issues with their philosophies (above was only one example) - but what happens when Blackrock finds itself under new ownership with different views? Would this not completely shift the paradigm of the current financial world?

&lt;p&gt;This question has been bugging me for years now and I do understand the reason they can be auditors, advisors, and investors all at once. Financial markets are extremely complex and Blackrock has the resources and abilities to tackle financial issues governments and companies have. I understand why they are chosen to fix those issues. But how are they allowed to act in all those roles that overlap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do understand the heads of Blackrock are also the founders and they genuinely seem to have a positive interest in society as they are willing to shift and adapt their investment and other business to a more progressive time - think how Dicks and other stores stopped selling guns. This was due to Blackrocks ability to shift market sentiment based on their philosophies. No issues with their philosophies (above was only one example) - but what happens when Blackrock finds itself under new ownership with different views? Would this not completely shift the paradigm of the current financial world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say they are untrustworthy, misguided, or are unable to pick successors. It just feels astonishing to see a company with such a far reach, especially in comparison to Vanguard, Schwab, State Street, or whoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"[Average Year](https://imgur.com/6a8bTkD.png)

The above picture is the graph of what the average year looks like for the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the span of Jan 1971 - Present. [It was inspired by this (now removed) post from yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gfg0g2/what_does_the_average_year_of_the_stock_market/)

On the horizontal axis, the days of the year are numbered, so 1 = Jan 1st, 2= Jan 2nd, and so on...

**How did I produce this?**

I used the daily closing values for the Dow listed on [this website](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/DJIA/historical-prices). This was the most thorough stock market history I could find on short notice. Let me know if there is a better data set I can use!

I wrote a quick and dirty Python script to calculate the percentage change over every day ranging from 1971 until now and take the geometric mean of those changes for each day of the year, ranging from Jan 1 to Dec 31.

I then put all of those cumulatively together to graph the above.

**What about weekends and holidays?**

The trickiest part conceptually may have been how to interpolate the data to account for weekends and other market closures, since those do not come on regular dates. Since I was using closing values, what I ended up doing for a typical weekend was just geometrically averaging the change from Friday close to Monday close over Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

---

For example, let's say we have the following closing values:

Thurs: 9000
Fri: 9100
Mon: 9300

Then I would calculate the change for Friday to be: 9100/9000 = 1.01111
And I would calculate the change for Sat, Sun, and Mon to be (9300/9100)^1/3 = 1.00727

So the list of changes would look like:

Fri: 1.01111

Sat: 1.00727

Sun: 1.00727

Mon: 1.00727

---

It's not ideal, and can probably cause some artifacts, but it shouldn't matter too much when averaging over a lot of dates.

**Other Graphs:**

I also constructed similar graphs using [arithmetic mean of daily changes](https://imgur.com/dzHFwgt.png) and the [median of daily changes](https://imgur.com/McTs0sT.png).

The arithmetic mean graph is very similar to the geometric mean graph, but is a bit more extreme. This isn't too surprising.

The median graph is much more balanced, which also makes sense. It seems that the most dramatic effects of the first graph are caused by a relatively small number of extreme years.

It would also be really easy to adapt my code to work with a different time span or index. I would just need the data. It might be interesting to compare the average annual performance of different sectors or market caps.

This means that if you can borrow money at 0% and expect a return of 0,000001% you are making a profit.

(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s shutdown is pressuring loans
tied to commercial real estate, with retail and hotels hit the
hardest.
April payments were late on about $7 billion of commercial
mortgage-backed securities debt backed by properties in the
city, more than double the amount a year earlier, according to
data firm Trepp.
About $740 million of those loans are considered
delinquent, meaning at least 30 days behind. Retail and lodging
debt, the sectors with the highest percentage of delinquencies,
accounted for 41% and 19% of the total.
Stay-at-home orders have crushed business at stores,
restaurants and hotels in New York, the center of the
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Owners of these properties --
including hotels in Times Square and shops on Fifth Avenue --
are struggling to pay mortgages as their rent collections fall.
The rate of delinquencies could grow if borrowers continue
to skip payments in May, which is likely given the shutdown’s
impact on the economy.
Some landlords are working out payment arrangements with
their lenders, but options are limited. Special servicers, firms
assigned to handle vulnerable CMBS loans on behalf of
bondholders, are too short-staffed to manage the sudden surge of
defaults and modification requests, said Justin Piasecki, a
principal at brokerage Avison Young.

,investing,"BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.

Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.


Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.

Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.

A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.

Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.

Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.

​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.

Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.

The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.

Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.

That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.

There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.

Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.

Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.

Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.

Fink also said he was concerned the worsening economic duress could further fan the flames of nationalism. The devastating impact from the coronavirus could make it a bigger threat to the global order, he said.

Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more: BlackRock Takes Center Stage With Trump Seeking Calm Markets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more: From Houston to New York, America’s muni finances are in tatters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"OK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a ""correction"" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.

The problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.

Retirees need a regular source of income, and dividends are one way to get it. Yes, you see the stocks go up, but in order for you to get money out of it, you have to sell. When you sell, that part of your money is no longer participating in the stock market.

So, if you want income and stay in the market, you need something that has reasonable dividends (3-5%) and have enough profits to be able to afford paying them for the long term. You don't want high yield (10-15%) because these are probably going bust or their dividends are going to get cut soon (especially if the high yield is the result of the stock plunging 75% due to problems with the company).

Oh, by the way, debt is exploding at a terrifying speed (think of all kinds of fiscal stimulus paid by all countries to their residents, citizens and corporations). Oh and what about household debt that has been built up post-2008? The US fiscal stimulus can't last more than a few months and when everything reopens, there will be too many people chasing too few jobs, putting downward pressure on wages. Exploding debt + collapsing economic activity = very very slow growth going forward (You complained about how US GDP growth sucked post-GFC? Think about how much lower growth will be post-COVID!) Lower growth potential means lower P/E ratios, which basically means substantially lower prices for stocks in the face of collapsing future earnings.

If the stock market is right, and that 100X P/E for Amazon is justified, then eventually, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc... will all go out of business and the market share will get eaten by Amazon. If that kind of consolidation is actually to happen, we will see the end of capitalism because competition will no longer exist. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, and holders of specific assets (namely stocks of Amazon or similar monopolies) will be quadrillionaires while the rest of the world will be incapable of saving money due to, for instance, a loaf of bread that normally costs $2 becomes $20. Money will become pointless other than for the purposes of the masses enriching the 0.01%. The days of a frugal person living on $10 000 a year on a $50 000 salary will be over as that hypothetical person's spending becomes $30 000 and basically can't save anything after taxes. Standard of living for the masses in rich countries will drop to third-world levels while third world residents will starve like they do in Venezuela.

Further to that, if someone who is single, childless and makes $50 000 can barely survive, and there are about 50% of people who make less than that. This will mean that the masses will stop having kids and when they get old, population aging will cause governments to go bust because of healthcare costs--not to mention that pensions cannot survive in negative interest rate environments that last for decades. Soverign defaults will sweep the globe and that is how humanity ends.

This is a rant about how, taken to the logical extreme of what message the stock market is trying to send, is anything but good.

,investing,"I like the idea of dividend investing but I feel there are many arguments on BOTH sides. I'd like to present a few and discuss them.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Dividend stocks aren't good because they just remove from the stock price.**

So that's true. I don't think dividend stocks are good for growth. I think it is a great capital preservation if the company is solid like $T. They are the same price as they were four years ago and it is an excellent way to accumulate shares.

**My question:** Is this more of a wealth preservation option? What about growth dividends? I'd say AAPL and SBUX are examples of this (although I think AAPL is starting to mature as a company, but that is a different problem set on its own).

**2) If they don't grow, why bother?**

I'm not sure what to say about this. Hence the reach out for opinions. I feel that while they don't excel as much as growth stocks, they do grow faster than bonds. A safe bet, IMO. Of course, assuming it is a diversified spread like SPHD which I own a small portion of.

**My question:** Can someone give opinions of good growth dividend stocks that I have not mentioned already? Secondly, can someone help me rationalize point two, where it gives a purpose for dividend investing?

**3) DRIP or no?**

I have a question on this  one. Why not DRIP? If not drip, I guess you can  use the dividend to invest in something else. However, I want to drip so that my dividend stocks accumulate faster. Catch22?

**My question:** I only gave an example of why DRIP is good or not good. Can someone give an argument for both sides?

**4) When to buy?**

I think it is best to buy dividend stocks during a recession. I say this for three good reasons. The first reason is to **accumulate as many shares as possible.** You can not only buy cheap shares at times of recession, you also accumulate shares with dividends. It is a win win if you ask me. My next reason is that I don't really have to worry about selling out. Finally, with dividends, I do have a **cash flow coming in** if I needed it (hopefully not relying on dividend income though lmao). Getting a few low thousand a months through dividends is not that far off or unattainable IMO?

With a grain of salt though, because companies cancel their dividend like Disney and Ford. Fair enough, but that's why I try to mitigate that risk by avoiding individual companies or selecting individual companies with historical dividends (Look up dividend aristocrats). Companies like KO etc. Of course if KO stops giving dividends, then we are in bigger trouble than we realize and cash would be a better alternative.

**My question:** I say the best time is to buy Dividend stocks during recessions. Why? Best way to accumulate shares. Can someone puncture my argument? Secondly, What dividend strategy do you use (loaded question, would appreciate it though)?

**5) Placement**

This one is easy, put it in your tax advantaged accounts. My question is, is there a good position or opportunity in a taxable account? I would put it in a taxable account if I needed to withdraw the dividend income (not DRIP). Unfortunately I live in California so I am dicked.

**My question:** Can anyone think of a scenario/strategy where taxation would be mitigated or even somewhat effective? More specifically and in addition to, when/how would you put in a taxable account? Please don't say when you  have no additional room in your tax-advantaged. That is assumed in this question.

**Notes:** This portfolio is based of off Paul Merimimans 'BEST-IN-CLASS TAX-DEFERRED ULTIMATE ALL-VALUE ETF' portfolio. I chose this portfolio because I liked how aggressive it was and centered around All Value ETF's. The only thing I didn't like was how high the expense ratios were. I also understand that Value Equities have not performed well the last 10 years or so but historically they have outperformed growth stocks.  


I know I am going to get a lot of flack for this because I am not using the standard 3-fund portfolio but this portfolio made sense to me. It is currently not doing so well and down 18% in total.

Is this something I should just ride out, stomach the losses right now, and keep maxing out my Roth IRA every year into these funds because Value Equities have performed very well historically?  


Or is this something I really need to be concerned about due to the high expense ratios and how poorly Value Equities have performed the last decade?  


These loses are hard to stomach at the moment but if I am going by history things will work out. I really don't want to sell out of these funds (Especially since I am at a loss right now) but considering this is my retirement, I am willing to do whatever is necessary.

,investing,"I know this is outside the purview of options bullshit but it’s an investment that is frequently leveraged up the ass.  3% down and you get 100% of the profit or loss, with favorable margin rates.

Here’s my theory:

A significant component in the rise of housing prices since the 1980s is due to declining interest rates.  The supply is constrained so it’s responsive to the ability of buyers to outbid each other.  Americans are used to the idea of spending 30% or whatever of their household income on their mortgage payment, maybe more.  If interest rates drop but real wages stay the same and the percentage of money spent on housing stays the same, then the principal has to increase.  Which means housing prices go up.

But now we’re pretty much touching against risk adjusted 0% interest rates.  If it was any cheaper the bank might as well be paying you.  The interest rate cannot keep dropping in order to fuel more housing price increase.  So there’s not really any more room for housing prices to boost off low interest rates.  There’s probably still time until they adjust to current rates and an increase when the economy eventually picks up again, but the growth seen over the past three decades is coming to an end.

Also, there’s significant risk if inflation picks up.  If housing and wages both rise in pace with inflation their ratio stays the same, but interest rates will also climb.  This means that buyers must now commit a larger portion of their gross income to P&amp;I payments.

,investing,"I've been keeping an eye on and recently bought TSX:RSI. It's currently trading at a 7.5%+ yield and is still trading about 25% off pre-COVID highs. \~$95mm EBITDA business with $5-$10mm of maintenance capex. Brokers are shitting on it because they didn't hit Q2 estimates (+25% EBITDA growth, whereas they were flat), but given the climate we're in - and yield it's trading at - IDGAF.

**Some thoughts on why I like it:**

* **Stable volume.** Yes, per capita sugar consumption is declining, but with NA population growth, it's stable to moderately growing. And with everything going on in the world, the fact that volumes have not been impacted is positive.
* **Limited price risk.** Sugar is a transparent, liquid market. RSI matches future sales to purchases, so it doesn't take commodity risk. It basically earns a dollar margin per lb.
* **Stable free cash flow.** Given the above, FCF is quite stable. Maintenance capex is relatively small. The company is a bit of a NWC pig, but given low volume/price risk above it's been manageable.
* **Low risk to distribution.** Given stable FCF and $100mm of borrowing room, distributions don't appear to be at risk. Payout ratios are high (biggest knock on RSI), but in a flat market and modest capital needs, what else are would they do with that cash.
* **Free option on Maple Syrup.** RSI acquired one of the largest maple syrup producers in 2017, which has been an absolute dog. But that capital has been spent, and so I view earnings to be somewhat trough-y.
* **Installed capacity.** I've been looking for businesses with good installed capacity in this market. Companies with solid PP&amp;E that have some nameplate capacity and earnings power. I like them because negative operating leverage is hitting earnings hard, but you should get torque on the way out of COVID. RSI isn't experiencing this, but it's good downside protection.
* **Duopoly producer.** One of two sugar producers in Canada, and no one is investing in processing capacity any time soon given growth trends.
* **Structural market benefits.** USA sugar market is a protected market with high import tariffs that can mean prices that are 2x Canadian prices. Food producers can manufacture in Canada with cheap sugar, and then import finished products into America without tariffs; drives steady demand.

**This one isn't without its hair:**

* **Future volume.** While it's positive that volumes were strong in Q2 2020, that might reflect contracts they sold well before COVID. That said, their product is going into shelf-stable products and confectionary, which are experiencing record-high demand.
* **Supply chain.** If RSI can't get their hands on raw materials because international supply chains are clogged up, then that would be a big deal. It looks like they have about 3 mos of inventory on hand.

It&amp;#39;s currently trading at a 7.5%+ yield and is still trading about 25% off pre-COVID highs. ~$95mm EBITDA business with $5-$10mm of maintenance capex. Brokers are shitting on it because they didn&amp;#39;t hit Q2 estimates (+25% EBITDA growth, whereas they were flat), but given the climate we&amp;#39;re in - and yield it&amp;#39;s trading at - IDGAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some thoughts on why I like it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable volume.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, per capita sugar consumption is declining, but with NA population growth, it&amp;#39;s stable to moderately growing. And with everything going on in the world, the fact that volumes have not been impacted is positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited price risk.&lt;/strong&gt; Sugar is a transparent, liquid market. RSI matches future sales to purchases, so it doesn&amp;#39;t take commodity risk. It basically earns a dollar margin per lb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable free cash flow.&lt;/strong&gt; Given the above, FCF is quite stable. Maintenance capex is relatively small. The company is a bit of a NWC pig, but given low volume/price risk above it&amp;#39;s been manageable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low risk to distribution.&lt;/strong&gt; Given stable FCF and $100mm of borrowing room, distributions don&amp;#39;t appear to be at risk. Payout ratios are high (biggest knock on RSI), but in a flat market and modest capital needs, what else are would they do with that cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free option on Maple Syrup.&lt;/strong&gt; RSI acquired one of the largest maple syrup producers in 2017, which has been an absolute dog. But that capital has been spent, and so I view earnings to be somewhat trough-y.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installed capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve been looking for businesses with good installed capacity in this market. Companies with solid PP&amp;amp;E that have some nameplate capacity and earnings power. I like them because negative operating leverage is hitting earnings hard, but you should get torque on the way out of COVID. RSI isn&amp;#39;t experiencing this, but it&amp;#39;s good downside protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duopoly producer.&lt;/strong&gt; One of two sugar producers in Canada, and no one is investing in processing capacity any time soon given growth trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural market benefits.&lt;/strong&gt; USA sugar market is a protected market with high import tariffs that can mean prices that are 2x Canadian prices. Food producers can manufacture in Canada with cheap sugar, and then import finished products into America without tariffs; drives steady demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one isn&amp;#39;t without its hair:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future volume.&lt;/strong&gt; While it&amp;#39;s positive that volumes were strong in Q2 2020, that might reflect contracts they sold well before COVID. That said, their product is going into shelf-stable products and confectionary, which are experiencing record-high demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain.&lt;/strong&gt; If RSI can&amp;#39;t get their hands on raw materials because international supply chains are clogged up, then that would be a big deal. It looks like they have about 3 mos of inventory on hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payout ratio.&lt;/strong&gt; It does have a high payout ratio and you can sensibly argue it&amp;#39;s risky. I don&amp;#39;t see it, but I understand the argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage.&lt;/strong&gt; Aside from 4.0x debt, the capital structure is stinky. A bunch of convertible debt outstanding (5%, converts at $8.00+) which might preclude the Company taking on additional debt and issuing additional equity - distributions would be first to go.&lt;/li&gt;

SHOP:

**New stores created on the Shopify platform grew 62% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 compared
to the prior six weeks**, driven by the shift of commerce to online as well as by the extension of the free trial
period on standard plans from 14 days to 90 days. While this increase includes both first-time entrepreneurs
as well as established sellers, it is unclear how many in this cohort will sustainably generate sales, which is
the primary determinant of merchant longevity on our platform. New store creations represents merchants
who have provided billing information, which also allows them to start selling.


While year-over-year Gross Merchandise (""GMV"") growth accelerated in April compared with the
first quarter of 2020, and this growth was distributed over a broader base of merchants, it is unclear how
sustainable consumer spending levels will be in this uncertain economic environment. For now, the shift of
consumer spending toward online is apparent: the number of consumers estimated to have made a purchase
for the first time from any Shopify merchant grew 8% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, compared
to the six-week period immediately prior. Over the same period, the number of consumers estimated to have
purchased from Shopify merchants they’d never shopped at before grew by 45% compared to the six-week
period immediately prior.

**While GMV through the point-of-sale (POS) channel declined by 71% between March 13, 2020 and April 24,
2020 relative to the comparable six-week period immediately prior to March 13, as most of Shopify’s Retail
merchants suspended their in-store operations, *Retail merchants managed to replace 94% of lost POS GMV
with online sales over the same period*.** Retail merchants are adapting quickly to social-distance selling, as
26% of our brick-and-mortar merchants in our English-speaking geographies are now using some form of
local in-store/curbside pickup and delivery solution, compared to 2% at the end of February.

While new types of merchants, such as food stores, are migrating to Shopify Plus, March and April also saw
more merchants downgrade from Shopify Plus to lower-priced plans than in January and February.

Certain categories of GMVgrew faster between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, including Food, Beverages,
and Tobacco, which doubled during this period relative to the 6-weeks immediately prior to March 13. Apparel
and accessories, a historically larger contributor to Shopify's GMV, experienced a softening in GMV in midMarch, followed by a recovery at the end of March, which continued into April. 

Mercadolibre:

The marketplace KPI’s hit a low point during the week of the 18th to the 24th of March. **Yearover-year growth for items sold during that week troughed at 3.3%, with Fx Neutral GMV
declining by 1.4%. From then onwards, we have seen a strong rebound, with growth rates
accelerating in April to 75.8% year-over-year in Items Sold and 72.6% Fx Neutral year-overyear in GMV for the full month.**",t2_j2syo,False,,0,False,Shopify Recent #'s + Mercadolibre +23% after earnings,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_gekay7,False,dark,0.9,,public,30,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,30,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588801600.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-commerce doing well - Shopify with some interesting stats (see bolded) and Mercadolibre, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While GMV through the point-of-sale (POS) channel declined by 71% between March 13, 2020 and April 24,
2020 relative to the comparable six-week period immediately prior to March 13, as most of Shopify’s Retail
merchants suspended their in-store operations, &lt;em&gt;Retail merchants managed to replace 94% of lost POS GMV
with online sales over the same period&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Retail merchants are adapting quickly to social-distance selling, as
26% of our brick-and-mortar merchants in our English-speaking geographies are now using some form of
local in-store/curbside pickup and delivery solution, compared to 2% at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While new types of merchants, such as food stores, are migrating to Shopify Plus, March and April also saw
more merchants downgrade from Shopify Plus to lower-priced plans than in January and February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain categories of GMVgrew faster between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, including Food, Beverages,
and Tobacco, which doubled during this period relative to the 6-weeks immediately prior to March 13. Apparel
and accessories, a historically larger contributor to Shopify&amp;#39;s GMV, experienced a softening in GMV in midMarch, followed by a recovery at the end of March, which continued into April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercadolibre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marketplace KPI’s hit a low point during the week of the 18th to the 24th of March. &lt;strong&gt;Yearover-year growth for items sold during that week troughed at 3.3%, with Fx Neutral GMV
declining by 1.4%. From then onwards, we have seen a strong rebound, with growth rates
accelerating in April to 75.8% year-over-year in Items Sold and 72.6% Fx Neutral year-overyear in GMV for the full month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Shareholders on Monday approved a plan to **convert nearly $1 billion of debt into equity and raise up to 400 million crowns ($39 million) from the sale of new shares** to help the airline survive the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Norwegian aims to sell new shares at 1.0 crown each, it said, far less than Tuesday's closing price of 4.80 crowns as it seeks to attract investors even while the debt conversion leads to a massive dilution of ownership stakes.

&gt; **If the process fails however, Norwegian Air is at risk of running out of money by mid-May** even though it only pays invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, it said on April 27.

&gt; The debt conversion will hand majority ownership to the airline's creditors and **could leave current shareholders with just 5.2%**, and with further dilution for owners who do not take part in the share issue.

,investing,"I’m thinking of putting together a market cap etf portfolio with a 60/25/15 allocation from large to small. I’ve been looking at vanguards market cap blend ETFs and upon closer look them seem to not accurately reflect the traditional definitions of the market capitalizations they should represent. 

Generally, the market cap ranges are as follows...
Small: $300 Million to $2 Billion
Mid: $2 Billion to $10 Billion
Large: $10 Billion or Higher

The median market capitalization for each ETF should fall in line with these ranges if it is accurate.

Below are the main Vanguard Market Cap ETFs and the median market cap value for each.

VB: Small Cap ($3.6 Billion)
VO: Mid Cap ($13.4 Billion)
VV: Large Cap ($112.7 Billion)

Most of these ETFs have a median value above the usual metrics. The Small Cap ETF is really a Mid Cap ETF. The Mid Cap ETF is really a Large Cap ETF. The Large Cap ETF is valued in the middle of a Large Cap and a Mega Cap (Mega Cap being a value of over $200 Billion) so this seems ok to me.

There are other ETFs offered through Vanguard that more accurately hit the definition. These follow along the S&amp;P Index for each capitalization. They are listed below with the median market cap value.

VIOO: S&amp;P 600 Small Cap ($1.4 Billion)
IVOO: S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap ($4.3 Billion)
VOO: S&amp;P 500 Large Cap ($118.7 Billion)

With the exception of VOO, these other ETFs have a median value of about a third of the other respective funds and they are also traded much less. Only VOO has a substantial Total Net Asset Value.

VOO is worth a staggering $443.6 Billion. It’s cousin, VV is only worth $21.9 Billion. Clearly, investors prefer to hold VOO. The same is true for the others.

IVOO is worth $1.6 Billion, VO is worth $84.6 Billion.
VIOO is worth $1.7 Billion, VB is worth $69.3 Billion.

Investors clearly prefer the funds that don’t follow the metrics.

Why would vanguard throw in a substantial amount of stocks that are in the next market cap tier into funds of lesser value? Is it to smooth out the volatility that small caps and mid caps usually experience? Or have stocks gone up in value so much that the traditional definitions no longer fit and Vanguard is making their own definitions. Comparing a $10 Billion company today to what a $10 Billion company was 20 years is not a fair comparison. Since we’re in the age of Mega Caps, should the metrics be expanded across all fronts to accommodate this change?

“large investments in small companies can actually have the effect of adversely affecting the share price of the small company being bought or sold in the fund.

The lawsuit is based on a California law that went into effect earlier this year, known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5).

,investing,"Disclaimer, this is going to be a long message.

With the oil market gone mad recently, I would like to have some insights from someone who is on the field. FYI, I have never worked in/with the oil industry, but as an opportunistic and enthusiastic learner, I would like to know what it takes to pull off a deal that would allow one to get paid for taking delivery of WTI crude oil.

So here are my thoughts and interrogations. Some of my questions can overlap with each other but anyway. All of them can be summed up in one question: ""If the same scenario of negative price occurs again in May for June's contract, how to proceed if I want panicked CL owners to pay me to take delivery of their crude oil? Then come the second top level question, how do I actually take delivery of this crude oil?""

But let's try to break this down into more elementary questions that have risen along my readings on the internet.

1. First about the delivery process. I don't understand very well how roles are split between different actors.

1)a) In CL contract specs, they talk about a Clearing House. What is it exactly? A quick tour on Google brought me to Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, is that the one? Is there an only one Clearing House?

1)b) Referring to that CL contract again, it's written that ""The Clearing House shall allocate Delivery Notices and Notices of Intention to Accept by matching size of positions to the extent possible"". Do I understand right if I say that it's the Clearing House that puts, nominatively, a bid in front of an ask? Isn't it up to the financial market to do that?

1)c) Apparently, some margin shall be submitted so the transaction can occur. What they call a margin in this CL contract is like a deposit, am I correct? Under which form this deposit has to be done? Money? How much? The equivalent of the whole transaction? Can you enlighten me about this margin thing? Especially when prices are negative, how this margin works?

1)d) Still in CL contract, they mention two companies: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Endbridge Pipeline (Ozark) LLC. Are they the only one companies handling pipelines and deliveries for CL contracts? Do they handle storage as well?

1)e) Are those two companies considered FCM? Or are FCM's completely different actors? How do FCMs interface with the Clearing House and the two companies mentioned in 1)d) ?

1)f) Can you explain me the difference between book-out, in-tank transfer and in-line transfer please? I'm definitely not familiar with those terms.

1)g) I read somewhere that delivery shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal executive orders and all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulation. Where can I find all those orders, laws and regulation?

1)h) Could you point me toward a FCM company?

1)i) What is the minimum amount of barrels required to be purchased so one can proceed to a delivery? I’m guessing that FCM/Clearing House/CME/Pipeline companies/Funds (big or small) won’t be interested in small transaction? What’s the smallest they toletate? I'd like to have an idea of the kind of money we are talking about.

1)j) CL contracts deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil that is delivered to Cushing. Does this mean that WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil cannot be delivered anywhere else? Is any other type of crude delivered to Cushing?

2. Then, relatively to storage itself, I can't find any clear picture of storage capacity, that's  
quite confusing

2)a) I thought that the US Gulf coast is now equipped with plenty of storage capacity, like 55% of US capacity (in Houston, LOOP in Louisiana...). How come everyone talks about storage issues in Cushing? It feels like there is only Cushing in the US (only 13% of storage capacity). Isn't it possible to transfer that glut of oil to storage farms elsewhere?

2)b) Is it really an issue of storage shortage or is it more about midstream infrastructures (I mean for transportation) not being able to keep up with this abundance of crude?

2)c) What regulatory requirements do storage facilities have to meet? Where can I find them?

2)d) What if I decide to store the crude abroad? Will US authorities have a say in the regulatory requirements met (or not...) by the facility receiving the crude?

2)e) Is there an easy way to get the big picture/map of storage capacity in the US, in the Caribbean, in Central and South America?

3. About the trading/acquisition of barrels on financial markets aspects; I believe not  
anybody can buy CL contracts (therefore purchase barrels) on classic financial markets  
with classic brokers.

3)a) How to get access to this kind of transactions? I assume they are only large scale transaction aren’t they?

3)b) I didn't understand very well the difference between CME Globex and CME ClearPort... What use to do of those two ones? I got the impression that I had to be on one of those two ones to trade CL contracts.

3)c) How CME Globex and CME ClearPort are different from NYMEX? Isn't NYMEX supposed to be the exchange where CL contracts are traded?

3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?

3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:

\-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?

\-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts

\-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?

\-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO

3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?

3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?

3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?

3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?

3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?

3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?

3)h) In case I can't (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?

3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?

3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What's the deal between the two them? How are they related?

&lt;p&gt;3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)h) In case I can&amp;#39;t (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What&amp;#39;s the deal between the two them? How are they related?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this until the end and thanks in advance for your answers.&lt;/p&gt;

For someone who is interested in penny stocks, here is my way to analyze WLL for your reference.

On April 1, WLL filed for chapter 11 to restructure. The price of WLL tumbled from 0.8-1 to 0.3-0.4 after the declaration. By the RTS (restructure term sheet) WLL filed to SEC on April 1, original stockholder will get 3% new issued shares (97% belongs to unsecured Note’s holder) and 15% warrants (4-5years duration), all subject to be diluted by the 8% stock stimulus package for the management and employees after restructuring.

According the “un-levered”, “low CAPEX” version pro-forma (lender Cleansing Materials) attached at the same filing, average FCF per year is 136m for the coming years. If we use 10x FCF for valuation, WLL’s equity value post-restructuring will be 1360m. If the Qty of new shares issued is the same as the original shares, there will be 91m post-restructuring shares outstanding. Thus, by estimation, stock price will be around 15 per share in the coming years if everything goes as the pro-forma. The value of each pre-restructuring share will be 15\*0.03\*0.92=0.414 after restructuring.

As for the warrants, exercise price is 110% and 125% of the amount of current unsecured note’s value, which is around 2B. According to the equity value we derived from the pro-forma, those warrants will not be in the money for the coming years. However, if the oil price surges tremendously within 4-5 years, say 60 USD up, those warrants might feedback fruitful return.

Furthermore, there are still 1B secured loan subject to be unimpaired by the RTS. How the company will pay the bill is still uncertain.

Generally speaking, evaluating company like this is highly speculative. In my opinion, the range of the estimated value of pre-restructuring WLL equity is very large, depends on how you assess the value of warrants and the feasibility of the pro-forma. I think price below 0.3 might be a bargain. How much markup you would like to pay will depend on how your confidence for the pro-forma and the perspective of oil price.

The investment for the penny stocks is never an easy job and requires much more detail study and check. The abnormal high return just reflects the extra efforts demanded for the time-consuming analysis and the super high speculative nature for those investments.",t2_4y7tvqpv,False,,0,False,Analysis of penny stock WLL,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_gejaoc,False,dark,0.52,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588797843.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who is interested in penny stocks, here is my way to analyze WLL for your reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; I wrote the SEC asking for CLO data of publicly traded companies. I received a prompt response. “The SEC does not track how much public companies hold in CLOs.  That is not a required line item disclosure so we are not able to track it based on a company’s SEC filings.”

I'm more and more convinced CLO (lower tranches at the very least) are going to explode over the course of this recession. Seems to be a hidden danger if it's left off SEC filings, and the credit swamp is flooding wider by the day.

I don't see how they won't fail as S&amp;P downgrades roll, hedge funds see the risk and sell exposure, bond ETF sell the downgraded funds to buy investment grade, yields on junk bonds start to rise, and these companies finally croak and die when they really can't refinance any more. Here's some more reading.

How far do you think the Fed is really going to wade into this shit? Isn't it too risky for them?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95""&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the SEC asking for CLO data of publicly traded companies. I received a prompt response. “The SEC does not track how much public companies hold in CLOs.  That is not a required line item disclosure so we are not able to track it based on a company’s SEC filings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m more and more convinced CLO (lower tranches at the very least) are going to explode over the course of this recession. Seems to be a hidden danger if it&amp;#39;s left off SEC filings, and the credit swamp is flooding wider by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see how they won&amp;#39;t fail as S&amp;amp;P downgrades roll, hedge funds see the risk and sell exposure, bond ETF sell the downgraded funds to buy investment grade, yields on junk bonds start to rise, and these companies finally croak and die when they really can&amp;#39;t refinance any more. Here&amp;#39;s some more reading.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"All the news articles are making it look like AMC fired the first shot by saying they won’t be playing universal films in their theaters at all anymore, but I think it’s obvious that universal instigated this by saying they would no longer honor the theatrical release window. 

I think this was a short sighted move on universal’s part. Yes, Trolls2 was wildly more successful than anticipated, but this was a result of such morbidly special circumstances that it can’t reasonably be used as a way to predict future success. I also wonder how many of those $20 rentals were accidental purchases from kids who just happened to have the remote in hand. 

With such a massive collection of movies available in every streaming platform’s catalog already built into the subscription fee, can we really assume $20-$30 for a 48 hour rental of a new release is going to become part of streaming culture? And if it does, that is still a fraction of the revenue a theater would generate from getting a family in the doors. 

I guess the question is this: are there enough families willing to pay for that rental fee, who might otherwise have waited until after the theatrical release to see the movie? And by “enough”, I mean significantly more than the number of families who would have gone to the theater but will choose to stream instead. 

My guess is no.

And now that AMC put their foot down (with cineworld joining their side), it will almost certainly be a net loss in revenue for Universal.

,investing,"I'm currently planning to enter the market and I'm concerned about volatility, since I would like access to the funds on a 7-10 year horizon. 

I came across an interesting ETF that uses an option collar strategy to protect against downside risk That is, it sells calls against the underlying securities and then uses the revenue to buy protective puts.

It's called **NUSI**, or *Nationwide Risk-Managed Income ETF*.

It's appealing to me for a few reasons:

* I looked at its performance during the recent crash and it outperformed everything else (SPY, QQQ, etc.): [https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg[/img])
* It pays out a generous dividend from the sale of call options, at an amount that is competitive with bond funds: [7.71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/nusi/dividend-history) 
* Although it has a higher expense ratio, it would be easier to buy this than try to build my own downside protection (e.g., buying protective puts), which can be a full time job. 

My goals would be to avoid inflation risk and have reasonable returns without a large drawdown.

I had two questions:

1. What might be the risks with buying this ETF?
2. What would the tax treatment be when the stocks they trade have protective puts on them? I believe it resets the clock on capital gains. Are those taxes deducted by the fund manager from the overall returns or does it get paid by the holder when the 1099 is distributed?

&gt; Once Buffett determines the intrinsic value of the company as a whole, he compares it to its current market capitalization—the current total worth or price. If his intrinsic value measurement is at least 25% higher than the company's market capitalization, Buffett sees the company as one that has value.

,investing,"I often get confused when people here argue whether one could beat ""the market"". Which ""market"" are they referring to? Assuming Equities, which equities and index? MSCI World? S&amp;P500? FTSE100? ASX200? Emerging markets? 

Many portfolios suggested here seem to suggest a strong U.S. bias for equities, and even an MSCI world would have almost 40% U.S. equity exposure. While it's true that the S&amp;P500 has had strong past returns over many time periods, there's plenty of research suggesting that over the same periods other markets have outperformed.

Let's assume for a minute that ""the market"" is the S&amp;P500 (or MSCI world index, irrelevant for my point). In times of low-cost ETFs widely available and being able to shift the weightings of one's portfolio relatively easily to replicate a strategy, I think it makes sense to compare this reference index and their **risk adjusted returns** to other indices along different dimensions. For equities, the obvious ones are

* **Geographic focus**  
Comparing reference indices in different countries can be an interesting exercise. Quite surprisingly, the Australian, South African, and Swedish stock market have had higher *risk adjusted* returns over different periods (16 years, 40 years, 116 years) than the S&amp;P500.

One might also look into historic performance of emerging markets vs. U.S, Europe or OECD.
* **Company size**  
There's plenty of research suggesting that small caps, at least in certain geographies, have historically outperformed large cap over long periods of time.  
[https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/) 
* **Company/market maturity**  
Over the past decade, 'growth' stocks have outperformed 'value'-stocks in the U.S. and other markets. 
* **Sector focus**  
Similarly, if one had put more emphasis on tech (e.g. NASDAQ) and placed their bet on buying QQQ, returns would have significantly higher since the past bull run. 

Now obviously past performance does not predict future returns, but it's one data point and can be considered alongside other factors. These include current valuations of such markets or sectors (particularly when it comes to investing lump sums at a certain point of time) and more importantly larger themes such as changes in political landscapes and the geopolitical environment, climate change and shift towards renewables, urbanization (or de-urbanization due to COVID?), digitization, etc.

With a lot of data on past performance of different indices available and reflecting on major socioeconomic and political trends that will shape our lives in the next decades, I'd be interested in creating a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs, which over the next 20-30 years is likely to outperform the classic bogleheads 3-fund portfolio or an MSCI world and potentially offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to those indices. Suggestions should be evidence-based on a combination of past returns and outlook into the future, rather than saying ""just put your money into FANG or an AI or ROBO-ETF"".

With that in mind, which mix of markets, or sectors, do you see outperforming over the next decades compared to a S&amp;P500 or MSCI world reference index, how would you build a low-cost portfolio based on that strategy, and with which weightings?

&lt;p&gt;Background: I am early 30s, stable income, no debt.  Have a 6 month emergency fund.  Everything else is free to be invested.  40% invested in equities (24% ETFs, 12% blue Chips, 4% in speculative fun stocks), the other 60% is free to be invested but sitting on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: How has the current economic climate changed your invested / cash positions if at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"There are a lot of people saying that the market should be going down right now. I used to be one of them, but I've backed out of that hypothesis. Now, I think the market is pretty well priced (aside from a few speculative cases). Here are my thoughts on that.

1. The companies with the biggest exposure to COVID-19 have already gone down in price. Airlines, cruise companies, hotels, casinos, oil etc. 
2. The companies that are going up in price mostly have good balance sheets or corporate debt options to cover 6+ months of operating expenses. Big oil companies are probably the best suited to weather this storm as they always carry a lot of cash to weather low oil price storms. 
3. Most companies without direct exposure to COVID-19 have a smaller market cap today than they did 3 months ago. Indicating an already expected lower cash flow for the foreseeable future due to recession. Q2-Q4 earnings will be trash, and that is mostly expected.
4. The affects of the virus and economic impact of a second wave has mostly been priced in to stock prices. Just because we get bad news about another wave or that we'll be in recession isn't going to affect stock prices much.
5. The initial affects and expected secondary effects of the recession have mostly been priced in. We all know there will be big layoffs in the coming months. 
6. Financial systems have been stabilized by the fed so the risk of financial institutions going belly up is pretty low. 

I know we hate to say it's all ""priced in"", but I can't find a good example a slow recovery isn't priced in. It seems like most stocks are expecting a slow 2020 with a pickup in 2021. That, to me, seems pretty reasonable. A early 2021 vaccine isn't guaranteed, but I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that we'll have news (either successful or indications that a vaccine is very close) for a vaccine late this year. Even if a vaccine hasn't been produced, we'll be looking at herd immunity in a few key areas. 

Some thing that may not be priced in right now, but are not guaranteed to happen (hence expecting them to happen is speculation).

1. An exceptionally long (2+ years) time before a vaccine is discovered. 
2. A very short immunity after being infected (only 1 year of immunity before getting reinfected). 
3. Second wave in China. 
4. A particularly brutal second wave in the USA.
5. Financial system collapse.
6. Particularly extensive depression heavily affecting large companies.
7. A swing left in politics hitting the cash value of big businesses. Biggest effect could be a halt in M&amp;A or serious anti-trust laws breaking up FAANG companies. 
8. Mid-Long term fossil fuel demand collapse.
9. Bankruptcies of publicly traded companies. I think this will cause the next bear market, but it's months away. There is still runway for companies with shitty balance sheets. And who's to say the fed won't step in to buy up shitty of shit junk bonds. 

In other words, most of the obvious stuff has been priced in.

With all that said, there is definitely quite a bit of speculation going on. Tesla and Amazon are the two biggest examples. Their stock price right now is expecting them to make 5-10x their current revenue. It's not inconceivable, but IMO it's very bullish on a 5 year timescale. Another example, USO seems to be bought up by retail investors pushing up oil prices speculating that oil demand will return this summer (and there won't be a second wave crashing prices again). If that's the case, we'll see the price of oil collapse again when the June contracts expire.

,investing,"I just happen to check several investments SoftBank invested in the US in the past few years. Many of them never took off. If you dig a little deeper, you will find many companies SoftBank invested call themselves ""technology"" company. In reality, most of them just add a little fancy tech into the existing operation on a particular industry and re-brand as ""technology"" start up.

For example:  Katerra. Softbank invested over $1B into it while the result is abysmal. It looks like this is a traditional construction company but led by former Flextronics's CEO. Katerra is plowing money into building new facilities while they can buy existing ones below replacement. Now, they are forced to close facilities they built a few years ago and laying off workers. (link:  [https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/](https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/) ) If Softbank wants innovation in this field, why not just buy a well established construction company and add hire some technology talents?  It should be way cheaper than put hundred of millions dollars into a so called tech start up? Would an established profitable general contractor like Manhattan Construction cost 1B?

Another one is Flexport. Is there any difference between Uber Freight and Flexport?

In reality, most of them just add a little fancy tech into the existing operation on a particular industry and re-brand as &amp;quot;technology&amp;quot; start up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:  Katerra. Softbank invested over $1B into it while the result is abysmal. It looks like this is a traditional construction company but led by former Flextronics&amp;#39;s CEO. Katerra is plowing money into building new facilities while they can buy existing ones below replacement. Now, they are forced to close facilities they built a few years ago and laying off workers. (link:  &lt;a href=""https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/""&gt;https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/&lt;/a&gt; ) If Softbank wants innovation in this field, why not just buy a well established construction company and add hire some technology talents?  It should be way cheaper than put hundred of millions dollars into a so called tech start up? Would an established profitable general contractor like Manhattan Construction cost 1B?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one is Flexport. Is there any difference between Uber Freight and Flexport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know SoftBank investment managers are pretty smart. They know most of their investment cannot change a particular industry or even remotely profitable in the long term. &lt;strong&gt;Why they make this kind of mistakes in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt; If they want to invest in office rental business, shouldn&amp;#39;t they buy Regus? Regus is profitable and operated by a good hand. They can buy majority shares and hire technology talents to add some features in their operations and then IPO it.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"So I’ve been looking at options and thinking about different strategies, and I was wondering if this one was viable. 

It’s similar to a synthetic long where you buy a call and sell a put except that they are not for the same strike price or expiry. You would buy an OTM call for a short expiry and sell a put for a OTM somewhat further out expiry.

The sale of the put pays for the call. This means that profits are realized at or below the strike price. So even if the stock doesn’t move upward you are at least breaking even. This eliminates the risk of loss due to sideways price movement.

This of course does increase risk if the stock price were to fall, but depending on the circumstances there may be a low probability of that happening. 

For example, let’s say you thought EURN was going to have an excellent earnings announcement. EURN is currently at $10 posting earnings 5/7. You can buy a $12.5 Call for $0.38 for 5/15 expiry. You can sell a $5 Put for $0.40 for 8/21 expiry. So you are overall ITM upon executing. Your total possible risk is $480 if the stock falls to $0, but the likelihood of losing money at all is extremely low because EURN hasn’t been less than $7 since 2013. If your bet pays off, you could even buy out the put contract if it was making you nervous due to the longer expiry and it should be cheaper at that point.

Cloudflare has been around for a long time in many notable pockets of the internet. I think the need and importance of content-delivery  is only to increase with the development of cloud networking.

&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has been around for a long time in many notable pockets of the internet. I think the need and importance of content-delivery  is only to increase with the development of cloud networking. Many that argue that &amp;quot;Google and Amazon could just replace them&amp;quot; aren&amp;#39;t seeing how important it is to just be dedicated as as security company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Dennys&lt;br/&gt;
They have a bunch of real-estate and are a pretty important part of American logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Draft Kings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company that&amp;#39;s been around for a long time that&amp;#39;s starting to play ball in the legal app world. They&amp;#39;re also well connected after many years of word-of-mouth building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Groupon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tech dinosaur. I&amp;#39;m examining this stock after the recent acquisition of Honey (amazon coupon scraper) from Paypal for 4 billon dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Planet Fitness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they&amp;#39;ve executed pretty well over the years. It&amp;#39;s pretty hard to beat a servicable $10 gym that focuses on cleanliness and casual exercising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Nissan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a pretty messy history and I&amp;#39;m taking a look at their attempts to turn it around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Lyft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think theyre the more focused version of Uber that focuses more on customer satisfaction  and acquisition over innovation and spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- KSU &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail that extends from the US to mexico&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Calavo Growers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are avocado distributers in the US that work with Walmart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Blackberry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;appreciate their refocus on secure IOT networking&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"**Core**

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion.

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Closely watching**

\- United Health or Cigna

This is only going to grow and wont change due to American politics for 8 years at a minimum.

\- Cisco

Same as Microsoft but for IT.

\- Impossible Foods IPO

I've been vegetarian for 10 years and Impossible Burgers has been one of the most mindblowing experiences of my life. The product is phenomenal and on a league of its owned compared to Beyond Meat. IMHO Beyond taste like cheap school lunchroom burgers and Impossible tastes like something I would be excited to feed my family. If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product.

\- Visa

They make a ton of money on transactions. I saw them hiring for blockchain development so it leads me to believe that they're adapting.

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.

,investing,"There's been a big wave of AI being pushed lately with Smart Homes, Self Driving cars, and many more industries. 

I've noticed a few companies in the fast food industry have already come out with many automated processes for doing things.

,investing,"There was a thorough [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/bb06dn/basic_cash_management_etfs/) from a while back that gave a pretty good overview of some cash management ETFs. They fell a lot more than I would have expected during mid-march (see below). I noticed that some of them fell by only 0.25% back in the 20% decline of December 2018, so seeing a 5-10% fall during March was kind of scary to be honest because it's a good example of how dysfunctional the markets were. The financial system was falling off a cliff. Only the government backed short term treasury ETFs held up. I'm also surprised that prime money market mutual funds did not break the buck. 

Anyway, is there any way we can trust the moneymarket-like ETFs like ICSH or JPST at this point?  It seems like money markets are being funded by the Fed right now, but I'm not sure if there's a way to really know if excessive risk is still there. I do not want to risk dollars to make pennies. My broker has very high minimums of up to $100k on their prime money market funds paying 0.7% which I find ridiculous. I wish I could get the Vanguard prime money market fund VMMXX without a fee but I can't.

I was hoping to see how it can be pulled into a spreadsheet. Google sheets seems to be an option. I'm a bit partial to Excel and Google seems limited as to the fields that can be drawn. Another option is through other web systems (Morningstar, my brokerage, etc) but they don't allow the manual sorts of things I'd want to look at.

,investing,"Hello all, I would appreciate any of your inputs. I've done quite a bit of research and arrived at these portfolios for long term dividend growth + yield.  I have a pretty long investment time horizon so there's essentially no bonds. I live in Canada, and like to take advantage of tax benefits such as the Canadian Dividend Tax Credit, which is why my portfolio is Canadian focused.

Due to recent events and quantitative easing by the Fed, I am worried about the stock market trading sideways for a long time similar to the Nikkei 225 in Japan. Therefore, I believe a dividend/yield focused portfolio provides a steady source of growth in the absence of capital appreciation.

One of these portfolios seeks higher yield using actively managed strategies (such as artificial intelligence via HAL.TO), while the other portfolio seeks to minimize MER. I will list them below and briefly explain my rationale:

# Portfolio 1 (Actively Managed):

* CI First Asset Canadian REIT ETF (RIT.TO) - 40% allocation
* Horizons Canadian Active Dividend ETF (HAL.TO) - 30% allocation
* BMO Global High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.717%

**Rationale:**

I know the management fee is high, but if you check the annualized performance since inception of RIT.TO and HAL.TO, they are 9.20% and 7.27%. I know passive management generally beats active management, but in this case it might be different. Real estate is generally a sector where active management can provide more value than in stocks, due to more inefficiencies to exploit. HAL.TO uses artificial intelligence and big data to predict dividend yield and sustainability, which seemed to have provided superior returns so far.

Plus, the real estate market might be in big trouble, so the active management of RIT.TO might be useful to implement proactive/defensive plays. It's also interesting HAL.TO positioned it's allocation to utilities as its top sector allocation, since utilities tend to perform the best during a market downturn.

In terms of BMO covered call ETF, I see it as a pseudo-bond that provides good yield even in economic downturns. I chose ZWG.TO because it is geographically diversified compared to the other BMO covered call ETFs. I've heard good things about ZWH.TO (USA only), because the covered call premiums are higher in the US (though ZWG.TO is almost 60% US).

# Portfolio 2 (Passively Managed):

* Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (VRE.TO) - 40% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDIV.TO) - 30% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Global Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.258%

**Rationale:**

These are the lowest fee ETFs I could find compared to similar competition. I personally really like REITs which is why I am so heavy in real estate, and VRE.TO is the cheapest compared to other REIT etfs like XRE.TO and ZRE.TO. I also like the MSCI High Dividend Yield Indices that XDIV.TO and XDG.TO tracks, which uses smart beta methods (Tangerine's high dividend mutual fund also tracks this index).

,investing,"I'm sure the landslide from Feb 20 - March 23 this year is still fresh in everyone's mind. 

I sat that one out because i was still working during that time and knew even less about stocks/trading than I do now(still new to this and learning), but I saw the profits you can make by buying puts at the right time. 

one of the strategy I saw some people using during that time was buy puts on the green days and take profit immediately the day after. I still remember the market was ""predicable"" in the sense that everybody know it's crashing, and those greens days are almost guarantee to be followed with bloodbath red days after. That pattern repeated over the course of bit over 3 weeks.

Now my question is : is this a common characteristic for a steep market drop? I'm only taking about the big plunge here. In the past historical charts when you see the market take a nose dive, it's basically a straight line heading down, but I can imagine it wont red days for weeks straight, it will probably have some strong green days mix with every 2/4 red days? 

anybody here is old/experienced enough to remember the crash during 2008? or even black monday back in 1987 ? 

I wouldnt post this and get shit on for asking dumb questions but most website dont really show you daily detail for the index, especially when it's so long ago.

,investing," Before I lay out a BUY thesis, let me first address the negativity:

* ""It's a penny stock"" - No it's not. The last closing price is $2.13 with a market cap of $1.43b. Widely spoken $nat ($6/share) here is under a billy.
* ""It's a pump and dump"" - No it's not. 39.85% insiders + 26.36% institutional holdings. You should realize that when dumb money from Robinhood follows anything in \~$1bil range, it's gonna move prices temporarily.
* ""The CEO was caught for pump &amp; dump"" - Sure, but not really. The CEO is an old Pharma billionaire. All the previous pharma companies he touched turned into gold. He owns 33.86% of Opko and continues to buy $100k+ worth of shares on every damn dip. Sure, he may have done some sketchy stuff on the side, but most of his wealth came from building empires. For the allegation btw, he got away with only [$5.5 mil](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/28/biotech-billionaire-philip-frost-agrees-to-proposed-judgment-in-sec-case.html)
* ""It's heavily shorted"" - Sure, 25.14% of the float is shorted, but I'm here to tell why shorts are about to get squeezed.

Buy Thesis. Not like I have much experience, but I've never seen a company this undervalued. Why?

* Testing, Testing, Testing. #1 reason to buy Opko is that it fully owns - Bioreference Labarotories - top 3 largest commercial labs in US (Quest &amp; LabCorp are two others). Drugs like remdesivir will come and go, but until universal vaccine rolls around, (which is mid to end 2021) people will need to get tested and retested to prevent the spread. Two weeks ago, BioRef's tests accounted for [20% nationwide](https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-pascrell-call-on-trump-admin-to-provide-greater-support-to-commercial-labs-testing-for-covid-19). That was when they were doing 15k tests/day. Two days ago on CNBC (yes, that alone should pump the price on Monday), the CEO said hey will be at [40k tests/day very soon](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) . [600k tests](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) performed already in the past 7 weeks at an average of 12.2k/day. Imagine a minimum of 50 more weeks at 40k/day. The demand is enormous. All of BioRef's testing cites are contracted.

* [Abbot's 5 min ](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html)[test](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) is not highly accurate. Also, it alone can't sustain the demand for all of US because it's simply not profitable for Abbot to mass-produce expensive device that is only useful for a year. For starters, BioRef doesn't sell test kits. They make money by putting swabs in your nose and analyzing those results.
* You know what else you heard: antibody tests. Guess what, BioRef can do that too. On the CNBC interview, he mentions that by mid-May, they'll be at 400k antibody tests a day. You know what all that means??
* Revenue!!! Numbers aren't public so best we can do is conservative ballpark. $25\*400K/day = $10mil/day for antibody + $50\*40k/day for conventional = $2mil/day. **$12 mil for a min of 300 days is $3.6 billion** **in revenue**. Opko as a whole did $902 million last year. 80% of the revenue comes from [BioRef](https://www.opko.com/investors/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0000944809-20-000007/0000944809-20-000007.pdf). Plus it's doing a bunch of other stuff like 4k score, [Rayadale](https://www.opko.com/what-we-do/our-research/rayaldee), and long-awaited [Samotragon trial results due in June](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/386/somatrogon-phase-3-pediatric-trial-results-will-be).
* The stock closed at $2.13 on Friday. When the announcement of testing came out in early March, it was pumped from $1.5 to almost $3 in 3 days. It was later dumped and shorted even more to an all-time low of $1.11. Now it's making an aggressive comeback. The stock was as high as $19.2 in mid-2015. Partial reasons for the decline from the highs were unsuccessful trial results and pump&amp;dump allegations I mentioned above. But **primarily**, shorts thought that Phil Frost buying BioReference Labs for $1.47 billion was unjustified. Two other competitors $DGX and $LH are $15 billion each. Now it's paying dividends. Never bet against an experienced Pharma Billionaire who has a third of his net worth in Opko.

TLDR: Buy shares or September (decently liquid) calls on $opk before earnings on May 6th.

Opko as a whole did $902 million last year. 80% of the revenue comes from &lt;a href=""https://www.opko.com/investors/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0000944809-20-000007/0000944809-20-000007.pdf""&gt;BioRef&lt;/a&gt;. Plus it&amp;#39;s doing a bunch of other stuff like 4k score, &lt;a href=""https://www.opko.com/what-we-do/our-research/rayaldee""&gt;Rayadale&lt;/a&gt;, and long-awaited &lt;a href=""https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/386/somatrogon-phase-3-pediatric-trial-results-will-be""&gt;Samotragon trial results due in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock closed at $2.13 on Friday. When the announcement of testing came out in early March, it was pumped from $1.5 to almost $3 in 3 days. It was later dumped and shorted even more to an all-time low of $1.11. Now it&amp;#39;s making an aggressive comeback. The stock was as high as $19.2 in mid-2015. Partial reasons for the decline from the highs were unsuccessful trial results and pump&amp;amp;dump allegations I mentioned above. But &lt;strong&gt;primarily&lt;/strong&gt;, shorts thought that Phil Frost buying BioReference Labs for $1.47 billion was unjustified. Two other competitors $DGX and $LH are $15 billion each. Now it&amp;#39;s paying dividends. Never bet against an experienced Pharma Billionaire who has a third of his net worth in Opko.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Buy shares or September (decently liquid) calls on $opk before earnings on May 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

So if a buyer of a CDS has the ""spread"" on the CDS tighten that means that they would be paying the seller of the CDS less of a premium, but the CDS asset itself would be depreciate in value since default of the underlying asset is less likely. Then on the flip side if the CDS spread widens then the buyer is paying a higher premium to the seller, but the underlying asset of the CDS is more likely to default and the CDS becomes more valuable to the buyer.

,investing,"Over the past few days I’ve encountered several articles mentioning the Buffett indicator and how it’s flashing red, signaling dire times ahead. For those of you that don’t know, the Buffett indicator tells investors whether the stock market as a whole is overvalued relative to GNP or not. For the past few months and years, it has been signalling that the stock market is deadly overpriced, reaching significantly higher than the Great Financial Crisis in the past few months. I think it’s missing one piece of information that makes it seem slightly more worse than it seems.

The Buffett indicator is simply the Total Stock Market Capitalization/Gross National Product (GNP). GNP is quite similar to GDP, with net property income from abroad added to the mix. For the US, this doesn’t add much of anything, only about a 1-2% change from GDP.  The more interesting part is the market capitalization of the stock market. In the US it is usually measured by the Wilshire 5000 Full Cap Price Index or a similar all-encompassing index. 

[https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php). 

In the link above, you’ll see that the Buffett Indicator is currently at around 132% (as of the time of writing this). This nets it a value above 120% - which is meant to be the “significantly overpriced” territory. Looking at the chart provided in the link, we see that the market has been in that significantly overpriced territory since the start of 2017 and has continuously risen until the coronavirus led market crash. 

As explained in the link, the lines in this calculation are drawn around a one to one ratio between market capitalization and GNP. I’d like to note here the underlying assumption behind the indicator: The real value of the market capitalization should be around the same size of GDP.  This assumption, as far as I can tell, doesn’t hold any meaning over the long term. 

Think about it, this means that the value of the stock market should always stay constant with respect to the size of the economy. How could that be true, when the companies represented in the stock market have been growing their international customer bases while the rest of the economy hasn’t, meaning their growth relative compared to the stock market companies' growth is smaller. Shouldn’t we expect that over time, especially over the past 10 years with the widespread use of the internet, large companies have grown beyond their usual reach and come to represent a larger chunk of GDP than they used to?

To verify this claim, one would need to get their hands on data that shows the contributions of companies represented in the stock market to overall GNP. If there is a rise in that value as I suspect there is, this would mean that the Buffett Indicator needs to be modified by using the total contribution to GNP by stock market companies instead of GNP directly. 

I’d like to note that I have no idea if what I suggest here is true, or if I'm missing something blatantly obvious. But to me it stands clear that there should be a coefficient associated with this indicator that represents the relative size of stock market contributions to GNP vs GNP itself. Otherwise, the underlying assumption is too heavy to hold true over long periods of time. With that said, the actual value of the Buffett indicator should be significantly lower than it is today, to reflect the rise in stock market generated GDP over the past 10 years.",t2_4td0ykpq,False,,0,False,Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator is Kinda Wrong.

,investing,"Do you agree with this sentiment?

A lot of investors (particularly buy-and-hold ones) believe ""selling at a loss"" is a sign of defeat and that loss realization is somehow detrimental to their long-term earnings, and that eventually things will go back up to break-even. 

I see ""you haven't lost anything until you sell"" posted all the time, as if somehow your unrealized loss is not a real loss, and holding is the best approach by default.

This leads investors not to fundamentally reassess the opportunity costs of what they hold, holding and hoping they can break even... someday. Only when things are to a bleak point where they are trying to salvage anything they can do they sell.

Whether a loss is realized or unrealized is irrelevant to the fact that the value today is what your value is today.

Markets rallied on these strong earnings reports.

Gilead (GILD) announced a successful COVID-19 treatment and is making it widely available for free. Mid-week, GILD announced a successful phase 3 trial for remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir's ability to reduce hospital stays to &lt;2 weeks for over 50% of patients. The drug gained FDA approval for emergency use and will be available to COVID-19 patients for free beginning next week. This event was another positive driver in the markets last week. 

Amazon (AMZN) profits dip due to coronavirus response, even though revenue grew by 27% since last year, disappointing investors. AMZN share price decreased by \~8% from the beginning of the weak as it posted earnings 20% lower than analyst expectations. Bezos told investors that the increase in expenses were from spending millions on developing COVID-19 tests to test all its employees and implementing enhanced cleaning techniques to prevent COVID-19 spread.

Warren Buffett sells all airline shares as he is uncertain what society will be like coming out of COVID-19. Warren Buffett announced he sold all his airline shares because he is uncertain about society after the COVID-19 crisis. Buffett stated with uncertainty, “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. I don’t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.” This announcement may have a rippling effect on the market as many investors deem Buffett as an ""oracle,"" able to see the future of markets.

&gt; Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

,investing,"I’ve seen a lot of posts recently about buyback and dividends, especially about the discussion of buybacks in the media, so I figured I’d explain some of the theory, or at least how I learned it, behind the signals they are meant to give investors when used by a company. 

Assume a company has extra cash: they have 3 options with how they can spend it depending on how they view the company, the industry they’re in, and how the market is valuing the company (technically 4 with debt repayment, but that doesn’t really drive shareholder value). 

If they think there’s a lot of growth potential they’ll use that money on CapEx, M&amp;A, R&amp;D, and other things to help the company grow. This signals they think they can grow investors money more than those investors could elsewhere. If they have more cash, or don’t see as much growth in their industry they might turn to share buybacks or dividends. 

Dividends are a signal that they think investors can create a greater return elsewhere than they can in the company (or at least are giving them the option to chose if they can since you can always reinvest) [aside, but this is why you may want to be cautious of investing in companies with high dividend payout ratios since they’re literally telling you you have better options]. 

Buybacks signal the opposite, they are the company telling the market “You aren’t seeing our value, so the best thing we can do for our investors is buy ourself since we’re so cheap”. Theoretically a company would do this only until they though they were getting a good deal. 

The commentary is then for all these companies doing large scale buybacks, “Did they actually think their best option was to invest in the company, or were they just buying back shares to inflate share prices more?” That’s a really hard to answer since the company technically knows better than us how they’re valued, but it’s also kinda shady when companies are systematically buying back shares every year at peak multiples.

,investing,"I get the mantra of, ""If we have a recession, all you have to do if you have a diversified portfolio (like an index based ETF) is just wait about 24/36 months, you'll then have all your money back, and everything else form there will be profit again!"" 

This has essentially been true for going on a century now, and this has also been true in most real estate markets in the U.S. . For some reason, I'm starting to think that won't remain true.     I could be wrong folks, but there's something in my gut that says the future is going to be a lot worse in terms of making general market investment gains compared to what they have been over the past 50-75 years.  My reasons are based on the following, 

1. We have way too much debt.  I don't need to tell you this, but our debt to GDP is over 100% and rising fast.  With this virus and trillions in stimulus/bailout money, it's bound to get a lot worse.  Not only that, this country is saturated with person debt I.E. student loans, credit cards, and loans up the ying-yang 

2. People aren't having nearly as many kids as they used to.  In fact I'm a typical example of a male millennial that has no desire to try and raise a child. 

3. The U.S. is becoming too unstable of a society due to political problems I.E. corruption at all levels of government even at the state, city, and local levels.  

&amp;#x200B;

4. This virus just made this whole situation a lot worse, but it might have been bound to happen eventually anyway.  The virus though is very unpredictable.  Even **Warren Buffet** was saying he is pulling out of airlines.    


What I'm saying is the market could go down, and it might not recover for DECADES!  If you think that's impossible look at Japan.  Their stock market capped out in the late 1980s and to this day they have never fully recovered the losses!  The reason being is Japan is saturated with debt, and the population there hasn't increased much at all.    

&amp;#x200B;

I know what a lot of you are thinking, ""Well Japan is just a small island compared to the U.S."" I get that, but I don't think that it can't happen here.  In fact, I think it could happen within the next 10 years easily if it's not happening already.  So to make a long story short,  the mantra of: ""All you have to diversify in something like an index based fund and if you wait long it'll always go up more if it goes down as long as you can just wait about 2-5 years tops is not necessarily true!   There  are no guarantees like that.

&amp;#x200B;

,investing,"COVID-19 will have lasting effects geopolitically. In particular, China and the East Asian pacific. The pandemic has worsened already frayed relations between China and the US. This will accelerate manufacturing outside of China, but this was going to happen anyway as China transitions to a service economy. However, the US and other countries are taking provocative actions by supporting Taiwanese independence, probably to distract their population from their own failures at home in containing the outbreak. China has made it clear that Taiwanese independence will trigger an invasion from the mainland. This is not surprising since Taiwan is essentially China's Cuba, and any hostile nation so close to the mainland is a huge national security threat for them. 

I don't rule out the possibility of U.S. formally recognizing Taiwan as an independent nation; in fact the Trump administration is so edgy that I think this is likely if he gets a second turn. If Taiwan declares independence, either by the U.S. formally recognizing them, or them declaring it themselves, mainland China will likely retaliate militarily and launch an amphibious invasion of Taiwan.

The second possibility is severe economic sanctions on China. There has been some discussion of this at the political level, but this will not ""make China behave"" as some would think, but make China more aggressive militarily. This would be similar to the US oil embargo on Japan in the 1940s. An isolate country with a worsening economy will have no choice left but to launch all out war in order to keep legitimacy.

Some people say, since China has nukes that a U.S.-China hot war is impossible. However, I do not buy that. If you look at China's nuclear capabilities, they have nowhere near the capabilities of the U.S. or the Russians. China can nuke Japan and Hawaii but I doubt they will be able to nuke much of the U.S. Whereas U.S. has complete nuclear superiority over China and can nuke them several times over.

personally i do not think that we will see another sell off until Q3

Q3 is the only earnings that can possibly surprise investors, everyone already knows that Q2 will probably be one of the worst earnings reports in the history of the stock market

what no one expects is earnings to be bad for Q3, everyone thinks a rebound will happen with positive earnings and well be set in an official bull market after Q3

because of this im fully bullish up until right before earnings of the big companies

i will be buying at lows for any company expecting a bounce up for everything, sure we might see some sideways trading or even small dips but i do NOT think that we will touch March lows until Q3 and that is ONLY if we have a bad Q3 earnings

think about this how you want, but all the signs are there

J. Powell literally said they have enough money to prop the market up for at minimum a year and they will do anything and everything in their power to keep the economy up

If you all have your bias' towards a bear sell off then fine everyone has their reasons

but thinking about ""where were supposed to be"" is a great indication of where the market is going.

everyone keeps thinking that we should be at ATLs right now because of unemployment and business' shutting down, but if we were gonna be there we should've been there by now

my best advice, buy at weekly lows for any company and hold and then just dollar cost average if it dips

were going to hit SPY 300 faster than everyone thinks and once we pass that threshold we might test it again as support but i really think were more than likely gonna keep going up

I can easily see SPY hit 400 over 220 by end of year

thoughts?

I'm a Japanese national, but have lived internationally as a third culture kid (TCK) in Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, Holland and now in the UK. I've done as much research as I can on investing and to what I've gathered, and what would suit my personal goals is to invest without much risk and buy one index at a time. To be more specific I can only save about 500£ per month, and intend to spend every 6 months (=3000£) on ETFs. Let me know what you guys think of this strategy, Im open for any discussion.

Secondly, I'd like to invest in Singapore's DBS Vickers to get their ETFs (they allow trading in Singapore, Canada (not taxed unlike USA), Hong Kong and US (doubt I'll touch that stock market since not sure about being taxed)), which is one of the few ways I can as a Japanese National (restrictions apply in Internaxx (Luxembourg), Swissquote (Switzerland) and Saxo Capital Markets and Interactive Brokers (didn't like reviews on their customer service)).

A lot of you are going to miss the boat on NAT (get it?). Here’s why:

Rates for shipping CLEAN product (refined gasoline, naphtha, jet fuel) are showing to be way more stable and are currently, insanely high vs DIRTY (crude oil) shipping rates. We are talking around 10x/day.

What does this mean? Crude oil shipping rates are still very high comparatively to last year, but are far below what clean rates are as of right now. 

Also, the fundamentals of NAT vs other tanker stocks just suck. There are far better options in the tanker world that will hold value better long term. NAT is among your worst options. 

The clean tanker stock that I think is poised to rally hard is $STNG. They have 42 LR2 ships in their fleet who are exposed to the most insane rates of all of the ship types currently. Their fleet is also modern and new. Refined products seemed to have backed up harder than crude meaning there is more need for storage on the water and shipment to terminal locations. It has dipped enough in the past week to make it a hell of a buy just before their earnings on 5/6. Q1 will be solid, but Q2 guidance should be
crazy appetizing as they are hopefully locking in these LR2 rates now.

I’m much more bullish on the tanker stocks with clean tankers. With that said, I am to the moon with STNG, long on EURN, DSSI and INSW.

EDIT: Lots of other variables at play here including the age of the fleets, order book for construction of new ships (hint: order book is very low so ship availability will become more scarce over time, good for rates) etc. Clean rates will most likely come down to lesser levels, but many experts seem to agree that the average rates for 2020 will be extremely good compared to recent years.

,investing,"These are two primary reasons why I believe market P/E ratios have to be higher today than in the past. Comparing the P/E ratio of today and decades of the past is almost like comparing apples and oranges for the following reasons:

(1) **Free Put Option** is ignored by P/E ratios. When you buy the S&amp;P 500, you’re also getting an embedded put option provided by the Fed and US Treasury. If market conditions get worse, these entities will support risk assets through liquidity (Fed) and deficit spending (Treasury). This idea about the free put option has been around since 2009-2010, but it has been further qualified with recent actions. The repo market problems we saw in 2019 showed the Fed will step in even when stocks are at all-time highs! This put option has only increased in value since the GFC b/c the magnitude and frequency of support is very high. This put option won’t always exist, but should as long as fiat currency is accepted, the USD is the world reserve currency and the Fed’s measures of inflation don’t go meaningfully above 2.5% to 3%.

(2) **Free Cash Flow and Low LT Rates – Tech Wins**. The foundation of asset valuation is the value of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows. When discounting future cash flows, the US 10-year has gone from 2-3% in recent years to 0.61% which increases the PV. You all know that. What a lot of people haven’t picked up on yet is free cash flow profiles differ substantially across industries and companies. If a company doesn’t generate much FCF, their firm valuation does not benefit from low long-term rates as much. Compare and contrast the cash flow statements of Exxon and Visa. Visa’s cash flow generation is nothing short of exceptional, and Exxon’s is poor. A lot of tech generates a ton of FCF and their P/E and EV/EBITDA valuations are very high, but I’d argue those aren’t really the best methods of valuing them because it doesn’t credit them for their best attributes, which is crazy cash flow generation. Discounted Cash Flow is the purest form of asset valuation.

Technology has become a very large part of the market today. These tech behemoths (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, V) generate crazy amounts of cash. Their cash flow statements are beautiful. A P/E ratio reflects accounting earnings, and does not measure true free cash flow which is the purest form of asset valuation. There may be a better example, but in 2019 XOM had $10.6B of Net Income and $5.3B of Free Cash Flow (Cash from Operations minus Capex). In 2018, V had $10.8B of Net Income (same as XOM in 2019) but had $12.2B of Free Cash Flow. There is a big difference and cash is king.

Question: The German 10-year Bund is -0.59%, so why aren’t European equities higher? Look at the composition of the European stock indexes – can you name any great European tech company? Maybe SAP? Dassault Systemes is basically the most US-like tech company in Europe and it stock has been great, but there is basically nothing else. Europe does have great pharma companies that generate cash flow but they all have very little growth. Europe has hardly any free cash flow growth and that is what low long-term rates love.

\#1. Free Cash Flow matters a lot more than EPS. #2. Growth in tech w/in the S&amp;P 500 has led to more cash flow generation than we’ve seen historically, so P/E should be higher. #3.

I've been interested in investing on margin for awhile. My thought process has mainly been, I should get into real estate because I see everyone making tons of money on it, mainly due to leverage. But then it seems like a lot of work and there's the opportunity cost of the down payment that could be in the market and REITs could basically be the same.

,investing,"While many people are talking about Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in the cloud computing war, I think IBM could be the dark horse in the race.

Ginni Rometty ran the company into the ground, but I think Arvind Krishna could be the next Nadella.

He has a PhD in engineering and was the senior VP of cloud and cognitive software. He seems committed to artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing, and blockchain technology.

I think the stock downturn today is mere facade with worries that this is not a ""cure"" or that the results were not the magic-bullet. I disagree. This medication will be prescribed everywhere as it reduced hospitalization by 1/3. Certainly more similar drugs will develop in due time but this is the first step. A Historic step.  That's a very important economic and healthcare space improvement. There was also a trend towards SS with overall survival and likely would have been met in larger numbers. With this all in mind and my own medical background, it appears obvious this is a good investment at least until the phase III publication.

This is the time to ride this wave. If the phase III results are published and lacking (doubt it) or a vaccine develops before the phase III publication, then jump ship. Gilead is the stock to hold for the next few months.

,investing,"hi, first of all I don't know a lot about investing, but I was thinking on investing on a x4 leveraged product that I think will perform well.

So I know that leverage amplifies both profit and loss but does it have an effect on a daily basis or only when I sell.

For example:
if I buy a 100$ stock at a 4:1 leverage and it goes up by 10% on day one then it becomes 140$ I guess.
Then on day two it goes down by 20% so the 140$ become 60$ because of the 4:1 ratio
Does it work that way?

or is it so that if I buy at 100$ and after going up and down after a month it's gone up by 50% so at 4:1 leverage it's a 200$ increase?

what I mean is : does the leverage only take effect at the time of selling?

I've done a lot of due diligence and self-educating, and have formed some semblance of a strategy.  I've written down a list of rules that should never be broken, and that is the basis of my strategy.  I would love some feedback and advice from professionals.  I apologise in advance if I fail to use the proper terminology, or if I've posted in the wrong spot.  

1. Watch any stock with RSI 30 or less which is below both SMA20 &amp; SMA90.

2. Analyze the MACD to determine the momentum of a trend and the chance of reversal

3. Read the news to determine the stock isn't dead(filing for bankruptcy, about to be delisted, about to split, major scandal)

4. Take a position if the majority of analysts say to buy or hold.

5. Move into positions with an initial buy worth 0.5% of total portfolio value.
	
6. Aim for gains between 8-10% above avg price.  Once a stock price reaches 5% increase start to Set &amp; regularly maintain Stop Loss Sells to protect profits.

7. The maximum value of any position should not exceed 2% of your portfolios total value

8. First Double Down triggered @ 10% loss.  Stop Loss Sell @ 7% increase.  100+90=190÷2=95(avg price).  7% increase from 90 is 96.3
	
9. Second Double Down triggered @ 20% loss from first Double Down. Stop Loss Sell @ 17% increase. 100+90+72+72=334÷4=83.5(avg price).  17% increase from 72 is  84.2.
	
10. Final sell at a loss should be executed after 5% loss from second Double Down.

11. Dont touch anything that trades at a volume of less than 3 million.

12. Try to avoid holding positions over the weekend.  Even if you have to take a smaller gain or a shallow loss(1-3%) to get out before market hours on Friday, it is generally advantageous to do so.  (This rule is likely due to my own anxieties.  I'm happier when I have less money on the line during the weekend.  A lot of news can drop in that 2 day span between trading days.)

I've tried to set up these rules such that one follows the other (I wont be wasting my time reading news about the stock if it's trading above 30 RSI).  I am extremely conservative because I don't have a lot of capital and I desperately try to protect the small bit I do have(my initial investment was $500, and likely won't add more capital until after I've started working my regular job again).  I trade almost exclusively stocks listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or S&amp;P 500.  Sometimes I trade crypto, but only with extremely good indicators, as the extreme volatility scares me a little.  I stay the fuck away from options and futures.  I'm interested in the technicals of Forex, and am open to trading put options after I've sufficiently grown my account.

Possible scenarios?

1)  Last month's ""small trader"" squeeze was a preview of this month's epic producers squeeze and we go to -$100, -$1000? because producers have no buyers who can take delivery.

2)  Traders who have booked storage at Cushing are waiting till the last minute to buy at spot prices and oil will not trade at negative

3)  Enough oil moves out of Cushing freeing up space for traders to take delivery

&lt;p&gt;4)  Open interest is for WTI June 2020 is relatively low but rising - meaning that traders who need to sell or take delivery are increasing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5)  Production cuts will only take effect late May/ Early June&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a disaster waiting to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible scenarios?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  Last month&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;small trader&amp;quot; squeeze was a preview of this month&amp;#39;s epic producers squeeze and we go to -$100, -$1000? because producers have no buyers who can take delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  Traders who have booked storage at Cushing are waiting till the last minute to buy at spot prices and oil will not trade at negative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  Enough oil moves out of Cushing freeing up space for traders to take delivery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  Does Magic oil fairy balance the supply and demand in time for June expiry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I think that last month&amp;#39;s oil crash was a preview of a much larger crash this month.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"So, there have a raging debate recently between bulls and bear.

I would like to offer my explanation in regard to this. Since this is r/investing , i assume most of you guys have basic understanding in regard to FCF Valuation. But in case you don't know, it is pretty popular subject if you want to go deep down into fundamental investing. Some popular resources i would like to recommend is [Aswath Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), [Valuation by McKinsey](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Value-Companies/dp/0470424656). Basically in FCF Valuation, you make an estimation in regard of future cash flow a company can generate in the future and discount it to the present time to arrive at the value of the business right now.

Since this is ELI5, i will not go into too much details. This is heavily dumbed down scenario, but i think it is enough to give you understanding.

Let's assume a **hypothetical company**. It is a good business with no debt, it has no risk of bankcruptcy in the near future.

Revenue = $1.000.000

Variable cost = 40% (this is the cost that incurred everytime you make a sale. Example : sales commision, product cost, delivery, etc.)

Fixed sot = $400.000 (this is the cost that incurred whether you make a sales or not. Example = Rent expense, salary, fixed assets depreciation, etc).

Net income = $200.000

The Value of the business is $2.000.000 (you can assume this is the market price, if someone actually want to buy the company).

For simplicity sake, we assume the net income is fully on cash-basis, so the net income also represent the free cash flow for the business. 

Assume that because of COVID-19, the revenue in 2020 will be down by as much as 50% and in 2021 will be down by 25%. It will go back to normal in 2022, so the terminal value or going forward it will go back to pre-covid value of $2.000.000

 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
:--|:--:|:--:|--: |
Revenue | 500,000 | 750,000 | - |
Variable Cost| -200,000 | - 300,000 | - |
Gross Margin| 300,000 | 450,000 | - |
Fixed cost | -400,000 | -400,000 | - |
Net Income | -100,000 | 50,000 | - |
Terminal Value | - | - | 2,000,000 |
Discount factor* | 0.9090 | 0.8264 | 0.7513 |
Present Value | -90,909 | 41,332 | 1,502,629 |

*I use 10% Cost of capital. It is calculated simply by dividing 1/cost of capital^n . In this case 1/10%. This is pretty high as you might see, [a lot of business has lower cost of capital](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar). And lower cost of capital will result in higher present value.

If we sum all the present value (Net income/terminal value discounted into the present), it will arrive at $1,453,042, compared to previous value of $2,000,000. A 27% decrease in value, significant but arguably much more modest than many people would imagine.

Of course this is just hypothetical. But i would like to believe that my assumption is quite conservative. Like with the 10% cost of capital (even after the fed slash rate), or long U-shaped recovery. But if you try the FCF Valuation (the actual one, not this dumbed down version), you will see that the value will not go down as far as some bears like to believe. 

==========
**What we can take from this.**

Yes, time is bad and many good business will record very low or in fact negatives income this year. But this is not as doom and gloom as many people wanted to believe.

We see company like Adidas, Disney, Yum Brands penalized quite a bit because COVID, around the range of 25%-40%, depending on the timeline you are looking at, which is actually quite fair in regards to their future performances.

I knew at this point people have enough with priced-in, but yeah, the current price did in fact have priced in the COVID issue in their prices.

Just because a lot of unemployment and low revenue this year doesn't mean the value of the business will go down by as much as 50% or even lower. That's not how it works in regards to Value of a Business. 

Imagine if you have a good family business. This year will be rough, but you and your family have enough to keep everything a float. Some random investor comes in and said ""whew, bad times eh? Can i buy your business for 40% of its market price?""

If i were him, i will show them the exit door right away. Why would i sell it if i expect the business will recover in 2 years.

But actually there is a lot of stock right now facing this condition. Their stock are heavily penalized, and it is your job to find them and if you right, reaping the capital gain from them.

In regards to myself, two weeks ago I'm at 25% stock, 75% cash. But last weeks i decide to shift gear and move to 75% stock and 25% cash (I have to thanks [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos) for this). I left 25% just in case that I am wrong and market will drive even lower than this.",t2_7nzm1,False,,0,False,How to Value Stock in a Time of COVID-19 (ELI5 Edition),[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_gbbs8f,False,dark,0.81,,public,29,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,29,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588337166.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, there have a raging debate recently between bulls and bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to offer my explanation in regard to this. Since this is &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;r/investing&lt;/a&gt; , i assume most of you guys have basic understanding in regard to FCF Valuation. But in case you don&amp;#39;t know, it is pretty popular subject if you want to go deep down into fundamental investing. Some popular resources i would like to recommend is &lt;a href=""http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Eadamodar/""&gt;Aswath Damodaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Value-Companies/dp/0470424656""&gt;Valuation by McKinsey&lt;/a&gt;. Basically in FCF Valuation, you make an estimation in regard of future cash flow a company can generate in the future and discount it to the present time to arrive at the value of the business right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is ELI5, i will not go into too much details. This is heavily dumbed down scenario, but i think it is enough to give you understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume a &lt;strong&gt;hypothetical company&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a good business with no debt, it has no risk of bankcruptcy in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue = $1.000.000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variable cost = 40% (this is the cost that incurred everytime you make a sale. Example : sales commision, product cost, delivery, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed sot = $400.000 (this is the cost that incurred whether you make a sales or not. Example = Rent expense, salary, fixed assets depreciation, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income = $200.000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Value of the business is $2.000.000 (you can assume this is the market price, if someone actually want to buy the company).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity sake, we assume the net income is fully on cash-basis, so the net income also represent the free cash flow for the business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that because of COVID-19, the revenue in 2020 will be down by as much as 50% and in 2021 will be down by 25%. It will go back to normal in 2022, so the terminal value or going forward it will go back to pre-covid value of $2.000.000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Discount factor*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0.9090&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0.8264&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=""center""&gt;41,332&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;1,502,629&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*I use 10% Cost of capital. It is calculated simply by dividing 1/cost of capital&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; . In this case 1/10%. This is pretty high as you might see, &lt;a href=""http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Eadamodar""&gt;a lot of business has lower cost of capital&lt;/a&gt;. And lower cost of capital will result in higher present value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we sum all the present value (Net income/terminal value discounted into the present), it will arrive at $1,453,042, compared to previous value of $2,000,000. A 27% decrease in value, significant but arguably much more modest than many people would imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this is just hypothetical. But i would like to believe that my assumption is quite conservative. Like with the 10% cost of capital (even after the fed slash rate), or long U-shaped recovery. But if you try the FCF Valuation (the actual one, not this dumbed down version), you will see that the value will not go down as far as some bears like to believe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we can take from this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, time is bad and many good business will record very low or in fact negatives income this year. But this is not as doom and gloom as many people wanted to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see company like Adidas, Disney, Yum Brands penalized quite a bit because COVID, around the range of 25%-40%, depending on the timeline you are looking at, which is actually quite fair in regards to their future performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew at this point people have enough with priced-in, but yeah, the current price did in fact have priced in the COVID issue in their prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because a lot of unemployment and low revenue this year doesn&amp;#39;t mean the value of the business will go down by as much as 50% or even lower. That&amp;#39;s not how it works in regards to Value of a Business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you have a good family business. This year will be rough, but you and your family have enough to keep everything a float. Some random investor comes in and said &amp;quot;whew, bad times eh? Can i buy your business for 40% of its market price?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If i were him, i will show them the exit door right away. Why would i sell it if i expect the business will recover in 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually there is a lot of stock right now facing this condition. Their stock are heavily penalized, and it is your job to find them and if you right, reaping the capital gain from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to myself, two weeks ago I&amp;#39;m at 25% stock, 75% cash. But last weeks i decide to shift gear and move to 75% stock and 25% cash (I have to thanks &lt;a href=""https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos""&gt;Howard Marks&lt;/a&gt; for this).

,investing,"Hi All!

Honestly, I have no idea what I was thinking subbing to all of the major investing threads on Reddit. Now that I am more aware of what the landscape is, I would like to help. Honestly, no snarky shit.

It's not going to be a panacea, and this isn't going to immediately, read...immediately, help with your confusion. 

Ok, so, I get it, market is at recent lows and now you want to jump in. Smart. Well played...oh wait, this doesn't look like a 001 econ class chart, etc etc etc. I'm not here to beat you down. You were right to believe now is the time to buy, but all of the  crazy confusion can be a bit well, confusing. Also, if you feel like it, cross post this to whatever Tatooine-esque investing sub you like. It will save me some trouble.

1. Do not start investing in the hopes for short term gain on the backbone of a knowledge base that's as flimsy as jello. Seriously. I put this #1 because it should be the most over pronounced the few of us that are well versed should be repeating at all times, regardless of it not getting all the sexy upvotes of a market slander / confusion post...why?
2. Most people that make short term profits in this are lucky, or have extensive education, training, professional experience watching economic activity. Seriously. This is why I am putting this second. Joe regular, having whatever non-business / economics background is not on the same ground that people with a well versed background. On the internet, you're not going to be able to tell people apart immediately, and ""free"" advice is everywhere.
3. If you don't fall into #1 or #2, go long always. Invest in high quality firms with strong financials. Names you know. Make a buy, and sit on it forever or until you want to cash out. OR, pay a professional. There generally isn't a comfortable middle ground (sure, exceptions). Don't do this when the economy isn't on the news every night...do do this, if you can, when the economy is the forefront. Good news hardly makes nightly news, bad news always does. If your gut tells you that times are tough, but you have extra, that's when you should look into the bigger names...but this won't always work...why...
4. If you cannot lose as much as you put in, don't. Just don't. Even for the best of us this is a well placed bet. There is no guarantee. Stop. Invest in a 401k with a strong fiduciary. A well managed mutual fund. Please help yourself and do not start using an app that doesn't base itself on constant deposits and steady investment. Investing is good, within reason. Bad investing is essentially gambling addiction. Call the same number, talk to someone. There are prominent media figures right now, from fairly popular sports networks, just making click money on being bad at this. Those people can afford to loose money, a lot of people cannot. If you cannot, go long, go diversified, pay someone.
5. I cannot overstate how much experience matters. I was going to wrap this up, but it had to be said. If you failed out of math, economics, etc...just stop. Pay someone. Being able to watch a trend in real time isn't for everyone. Knowing economic indicators, geopolitics, and cyclical business schedules matters. In the short-term it matters a lot. I make money swing trading market trends, on top of playing standard long positions. I can do that because I can absorb a variety of information and know what to do with it. Seriously, 3 media inputs and flat numbers. I cannot overstate how much most people should make safe bets long.

And that's that, for now. I may cross-post on my own, but have just wanted to get that out.

,investing,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk lashed out at government stay at home orders as “fascist” in an expletive-laced rant on Tesla’s Q1 2020 earnings call.

While answering analysts’ questions about liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic, Musk called shelter-in-place orders “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights.”


Musk said he was concerned about not being able to resume operations at the company’s factory in Fremont, California, saying that possibility should be considered “a serious risk” given Tesla produces most of its cars there in addition to its Shanghai-based plant. Tesla had initially said the factory it would remain open despite shelter-in -lace orders until the county where it’s located said it could not be considered an essential business. Six counties, including Alameda, where Tesla’s factory is located, recently extended their shelter-in-place orders through the end of May. 

Musk had spoken out about government restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Twitter, but further expressed his opinion on Wednesday’s call while encouraging government officials to invest in infrastructure. He praised China for having “much better” infrastructure than the U.S.

“This is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights as what is happening right now?” Musk said.

“I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody should be, if somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

At another point on the call, he said, “So the expansion of the shelter in place or as we call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all their constitutional rights, is my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or built this country, excuse me. It’s outrage, it’s an outrage. It will cause loss, great, great harm, but not just to Tesla, but any company. And while people will weather the storm there are many small companies that will not,” he said.

He continued sounding more and more incensed, at one point asking, “What the f--k?”

The Bay Area’s orders do not say that people cannot leave their house, but do restrict non-essential businesses from staying open and ban many other activities, such as large public gatherings.

Some states, including Michigan and Texas, have seen protests of stay at home orders as fears about economic deterioration grow. But public health officials have cautioned that reopening too quickly could result in cases of Covid-19 re-accelerating and developing new hot spots that could overwhelm health systems.

&lt;p&gt;According to BofA, equity allocation was at it&amp;#39;s lowest level since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the bears care to explain how a market can be a bubble with that level of allocation?&lt;/p&gt;

They've opened up their stores in mainland China and Asia for full operations but clearly that wasn't going to change the fact that nobody wants to shop in this environment. They've had some problems integrating their Stuart Weitzman acquisition before the virus came around and the closures fared them no better. They drew down $700M of their $900M revolving credit agreement this past quarter through Bank of America and a few other banks (which, as long as they can maintain a consolidated debt plus 600% of consolidated lease expense to consolidated EBITDAR ratio of 4.00/1.00, once again BIG THANKS to /u/fuzzyblankeet for the r/wsb negative covenants run through you did, seriously guys if you haven't read his posts on $SEAS, $PLAY, and $F, **mandatory reading for learning about debt, the company should be fine as long as they can stay under that ratio)**. I'm bullish on this industry because realistically speaking people aren't going to stop their stupid spending habits and online sales helped stop some of the decline in store sales for TPR this past quarter. I don't like that they extend more credit to their customers than they receive in cash (this is what I got out of the negative change in accounts receivables for the most recent quarters, it tends to be negative, which means people are paying with credit and just paying it off slowly, which is probably endemic to the luxury goods industry, I'm going through Capri Holdings' 10-k also so I'm going to figure this out in more depth). Good work on the CEO for cutting dividends and buybacks quickly (these should be treats when the shareholders don't get in the way of the long term prospects of the company). The $700M is going to head towards operating expenses and working capital and so forth. I'm a shareholder and long $TPR for the record. I think the virus and recession we're in now is a blip.

They're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.

Point being, the following realities are inevitable:

* People will hoard the money supply
* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate
* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low
* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations
* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout

This is a **liquidity trap**. There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to ""price"" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to buy time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled. Stocks will crash again (hoarding cash), and harder; followed by a multi-year theta market marked by incremental inflation until we transition to a much needed growth period. Or we'll try and print our way to inflation -- with consumer spending as the operative variable.

Welcome to the debt bubble! FYI, whatever medicine we use to resolve this will ultimately form the cause of our next bubble. So on and so forth...

* Globalization created cheap external labor which spurred economic investment/growth. This bubble created wage imbalance
* Wage imbalance resulted in risky/unregulated/low interest lending which was a boon for big banks and consumer spending for nearly two decades. This bubble created debt
* Debt caused the mortgage crisis of 2008 which resulted in a massive recession second only to the Great Depression. This bubble created QE
* QE caused the liquidity trap of 2020 which resulted in a massive deflationary spiral akin to the recession. This bubble was created by excess and unnecessary money supply in a period of low demand
* Wage increase (through Federal stimulus check or other) will get us out of recession. But again, it will also form the cause of our next bubble.

,investing,"The Nasdaq is basically flat year to date. All the FAANG stocks are near all time highs. Facebook, Netflix and Google all missed on EPS estimates. Apple is likely to be hit even worse (sales are down and stores are closed) which leaves Amazon as the only member of FAANG that is likely to beat on earnings. EDIT: NEVERMIND, AMAZON MISSED ON EPS TOO. Surprisingly Apple was the only beat but that's because their estimates were low.

Here's the thing... According to earnings calls and the current economic trend, they were only beginning to experience negative effects for the last few weeks of the quarter. GDP declined by 4.8% this quarter, whereas economists are projecting a decline of 30% to 40% next quarter.

If we look at tech across the board, we have some winners like Microsoft and Zoom, but chip makers like AMD (which met EPS estimates but didn't beat) and Qualcom both delivered poor guidance for coming quarters. AMD has been rallying back to all time highs. Nvidia is also near all time highs. Yet, despite the relative strength in the tech sector, the current trend of earnings, economic forecasts and guidance (or lack thereof) strongly suggests that tech will take a huge hit in coming quarters.

Let's look at how concentrated the S&amp;P is in the very top stocks, all of which are tech... [https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg) This blows the dot com boom out of the water. Now consider how much of the S&amp;P the rest of the tech stocks account for.

All of this is to say, watch these tech stocks closely.  If they fall, the indexes will go with them. There is a high probability they will lead the next leg of the drop.

Also, here's my take on the long term value of these stocks. The US is moving closer and closer towards adopting basic income. Nothing is guaranteed, but if anything has made the case for increased automation and basic income, it's the current circumstance. Such a policy would likely necessitate a rise in corporate taxes or a VAT. That's a direct hit to  the earnings of notorious tax evaders like Amazon. In addition, basic income would give working class people more leverage in holding out for higher pay because they wouldn't be weighing job offers against total destitution. This too would detract heavily from future earnings.

After the 2000 crash, the Nasdaq didn't recover to the highs for 15 years. If you look at the S&amp;P chart I posted, two of the top five stocks in 2000 were Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft took 16 years to recover to its highs and Intel never fully recovered.

Therefor, I advise extreme caution in this environment. Do not be shamed out of taking profits near all time highs if that's what you personally feel comfortable with. I won't say it's wrong to hold if you're ready to accept the risk, however, just because these companies are good ""blue chips stocks"" that doesn't mean that they're low risk or no risk, regardless of your time horizon. That's just my two cents.

,investing,"By Sally Bakewell and Lisa Lee

(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s engineering was supposed to
turn loans to junk-rated companies into relatively safe bonds
known as collateralized loan obligations. As the new coronavirus
slams the economy, some investors are finding that safety to be
fleeting.

Interest and principal payments are at risk of being cut
off for investment-grade CLOs in around a dozen different
transactions totaling a few billion dollars, according to people
with knowledge of the matter. The notes at risk have ratings as
high as the A tier, well within high-grade territory, and were
sold by name-brand money managers like Marathon Asset Management and Pretium Partners, the people said.

The securities are being battered as the Covid-19 pandemic
is bringing an economic downturn far worse than many CLOs were
designed to withstand, with some estimates for unemployment in
the second quarter reaching 30%. Loans are getting downgraded
and their value is dropping, which is triggering protections
designed to protect the safest securities issued by CLOs, those
rated AAA.

It’s the first time these safeguards, known as senior
overcollateralization tests, have been this widely triggered
since the 2008 financial crisis. Many more deals could meet the
same fate in the coming months. CLOs, a $700 billion market of
securities carrying ratings ranging from junk to AAA, were
largely left out of Federal Reserve stimulus programs.

“I don’t know anybody that modeled a CLO, or any other
structured product, around unemployment soaring from about 3% to the levels we could be facing in the next few weeks,” said Elen
Callahan, head of research at the Structured Finance
Association, a trade group. “If you told an analyst to model
that, they wouldn’t know what to do.”

The lowest-ranking securities sold by CLOs are most at
risk. Of the roughly 900 deals that have posted data over the
last month, around 21% have had cash payments cut down or cut
off from the riskiest portion of their deals, known as the
equity, according to Bank of America. In certain cases, junk-
rated notes, which are less risky than the equity, have been
affected as well. In mid-April, some analysts were expecting as
many as 1 in 3 CLOs to have to limit payouts to holders of their
riskiest securities.

Prices can end up dropping on securities in a deal where
payments have been cut off, because investors worry about the
quality of the loans backing the transaction, said Jason
Merrill, a CLO specialist at Penn Mutual Asset Management.
“It’s broadly considered a sign of deal distress,” Merrill
said.

While investors might expect high-yield securities to
suffer in a downturn, investment-grade instruments are supposed
to be less vulnerable. During the last financial crisis, CLO
bonds rated AA or AAA saw no defaults due to downgrades of the
underlying loans. The default rates for A and BBB rated notes
were infinitesimal, amounting to less than 0.01%, according to
the Structured Finance Association’s Callahan.

Bondholders could face curtailed payments as CLOs fail the
senior over-collateralization tests, which require the value of
the loans a CLO holds to exceed the value of the bonds it issued
by a sufficient amount. Failing that requirement results in
interest and principal payments getting deferred on the bonds
and cut off to equity. Those are instead diverted to pay down
the safest notes issued by the CLO.

CLOs issued by firms including Marathon, Pretium and
Jefferies Finance have failed these tests. If the portfolio
grows in value sufficiently over time relative to the
liabilities, the failure is “cured” and payments to investors
can resume. With the Jefferies transaction, it used cash built
up from loan repayments that couldn’t be used to buy new loans,
since the CLO’s reinvestment period had ended, to remedy the
deal’s breaches.

Representatives at Pretium, Marathon and Jefferies declined
to comment.

CLO portfolio managers can sometimes cure their shortfalls
through skillful trading, but loan downgrades have come so fast
that many managers were unable to shed poorly performing loans
quickly enough in recent weeks. Even more transactions are
failing less stringent tests of whether the deal has enough
collateral, known as interest-diversion tests.

“We are only at the beginning of the first inning of seeing
significant distress in the leveraged loan market,” said Michael
Barnes, executive chairman at Tiptree Inc., and founding partner
of Tricadia Holdings, an investment manager that also issued
CLOs. “It may severely impact equity, BBs and possibly BBBs with
capital losses in the coming years.”

The record surge in downgrades has pushed more CLOs to sell
loans they own: debt to companies rated CCC can usually only
account for about 7.5% of the holdings of a portfolio backing a
CLO under the terms of the securities.

With recent rating cuts, many portfolios saw these limits
exceeded. CLOs have to mark those excess loans at their market
trading price, which effectively lowers the value of the
collateral. That can spark more overcollateralization-test
breaches, potentially creating a downward spiral.

There will almost certainly be more CLOs selling loans,
depressing the value of their assets further. There’s little
sign that the businesses paralyzed by the pandemic can soon
return to normal levels of revenue generation that would improve
their financial standing. Moody’s Investors Service placed about
$22 billion of CLO securities -- which get rated separately from
their underlying loans -- on watch for a downgrade earlier this
month, citing the deterioration in corporate credit quality.
CLOs have these tests to protect the senior bondholders.

Market participants tout them as mechanisms that specifically
fortify CLOs against credit shocks, although whether they can
outlast a shock of this magnitude remains to be seen. Bank of
America said in a report earlier this month that failing
overcollateralization tests for investment-grade portions of
transactions likely hasn’t happened since the 2008 financial
crisis.

Here are some of the deals that have failed overcollateralization tests for investment-grade securities:

* The Pretium deal, called Crown Point CLO 6, was a reset of a
deal originally issued by NewMark Capital in 2014. Pretium
agreed to acquire two of NewMark Capital’s CLO assets in 2018.
The Marathon deal, CLO VI, was issued in 2014, and its re-
investment period, or the period during which the CLO manager
trades in an out of loans, ends next month meaning it had less
flexibility to remedy the breach.

* The Jefferies deal, Apex Credit CLO 2015-II, used loan
repayments that it hadn’t re-invested in new debt to effectively
“cure” the breach and ultimately then passed the tests, one of
the people familiar with the matter said.

* A middle-market CLO managed by ArrowMark Partners, Peaks

representative for the Denver-based firm declined to comment.",t2_lx4lc,False,,0,False,CLO Engineering Is No Match for Covid-19 as Payments Get Cut Off,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_gaxocu,False,dark,0.79,,public,15,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,15,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588288977.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sally Bakewell and Lisa Lee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s engineering was supposed to
turn loans to junk-rated companies into relatively safe bonds
known as collateralized loan obligations. As the new coronavirus
slams the economy, some investors are finding that safety to be
fleeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest and principal payments are at risk of being cut
off for investment-grade CLOs in around a dozen different
transactions totaling a few billion dollars, according to people
with knowledge of the matter. The notes at risk have ratings as
high as the A tier, well within high-grade territory, and were
sold by name-brand money managers like Marathon Asset Management and Pretium Partners, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The securities are being battered as the Covid-19 pandemic
is bringing an economic downturn far worse than many CLOs were
designed to withstand, with some estimates for unemployment in
the second quarter reaching 30%. Loans are getting downgraded
and their value is dropping, which is triggering protections
designed to protect the safest securities issued by CLOs, those
rated AAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time these safeguards, known as senior
overcollateralization tests, have been this widely triggered
since the 2008 financial crisis. Many more deals could meet the
same fate in the coming months. CLOs, a $700 billion market of
securities carrying ratings ranging from junk to AAA, were
largely left out of Federal Reserve stimulus programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know anybody that modeled a CLO, or any other
structured product, around unemployment soaring from about 3% to the levels we could be facing in the next few weeks,” said Elen
Callahan, head of research at the Structured Finance
Association, a trade group. “If you told an analyst to model
that, they wouldn’t know what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lowest-ranking securities sold by CLOs are most at
risk. Of the roughly 900 deals that have posted data over the
last month, around 21% have had cash payments cut down or cut
off from the riskiest portion of their deals, known as the
equity, according to Bank of America. In certain cases, junk-
rated notes, which are less risky than the equity, have been
affected as well. In mid-April, some analysts were expecting as
many as 1 in 3 CLOs to have to limit payouts to holders of their
riskiest securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices can end up dropping on securities in a deal where
payments have been cut off, because investors worry about the
quality of the loans backing the transaction, said Jason
Merrill, a CLO specialist at Penn Mutual Asset Management.
“It’s broadly considered a sign of deal distress,” Merrill
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While investors might expect high-yield securities to
suffer in a downturn, investment-grade instruments are supposed
to be less vulnerable. During the last financial crisis, CLO
bonds rated AA or AAA saw no defaults due to downgrades of the
underlying loans. The default rates for A and BBB rated notes
were infinitesimal, amounting to less than 0.01%, according to
the Structured Finance Association’s Callahan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bondholders could face curtailed payments as CLOs fail the
senior over-collateralization tests, which require the value of
the loans a CLO holds to exceed the value of the bonds it issued
by a sufficient amount. Failing that requirement results in
interest and principal payments getting deferred on the bonds
and cut off to equity. Those are instead diverted to pay down
the safest notes issued by the CLO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLOs issued by firms including Marathon, Pretium and
Jefferies Finance have failed these tests. If the portfolio
grows in value sufficiently over time relative to the
liabilities, the failure is “cured” and payments to investors
can resume. With the Jefferies transaction, it used cash built
up from loan repayments that couldn’t be used to buy new loans,
since the CLO’s reinvestment period had ended, to remedy the
deal’s breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives at Pretium, Marathon and Jefferies declined
to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLO portfolio managers can sometimes cure their shortfalls
through skillful trading, but loan downgrades have come so fast
that many managers were unable to shed poorly performing loans
quickly enough in recent weeks. Even more transactions are
failing less stringent tests of whether the deal has enough
collateral, known as interest-diversion tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are only at the beginning of the first inning of seeing
significant distress in the leveraged loan market,” said Michael
Barnes, executive chairman at Tiptree Inc., and founding partner
of Tricadia Holdings, an investment manager that also issued
CLOs. “It may severely impact equity, BBs and possibly BBBs with
capital losses in the coming years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The record surge in downgrades has pushed more CLOs to sell
loans they own: debt to companies rated CCC can usually only
account for about 7.5% of the holdings of a portfolio backing a
CLO under the terms of the securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With recent rating cuts, many portfolios saw these limits
exceeded. CLOs have to mark those excess loans at their market
trading price, which effectively lowers the value of the
collateral. That can spark more overcollateralization-test
breaches, potentially creating a downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will almost certainly be more CLOs selling loans,
depressing the value of their assets further. There’s little
sign that the businesses paralyzed by the pandemic can soon
return to normal levels of revenue generation that would improve
their financial standing. Moody’s Investors Service placed about
$22 billion of CLO securities -- which get rated separately from
their underlying loans -- on watch for a downgrade earlier this
month, citing the deterioration in corporate credit quality.
CLOs have these tests to protect the senior bondholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market participants tout them as mechanisms that specifically
fortify CLOs against credit shocks, although whether they can
outlast a shock of this magnitude remains to be seen. Bank of
America said in a report earlier this month that failing
overcollateralization tests for investment-grade portions of
transactions likely hasn’t happened since the 2008 financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the deals that have failed overcollateralization tests for investment-grade securities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pretium deal, called Crown Point CLO 6, was a reset of a
deal originally issued by NewMark Capital in 2014. Pretium
agreed to acquire two of NewMark Capital’s CLO assets in 2018.
The Marathon deal, CLO VI, was issued in 2014, and its re-
investment period, or the period during which the CLO manager
trades in an out of loans, ends next month meaning it had less
flexibility to remedy the breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jefferies deal, Apex Credit CLO 2015-II, used loan
repayments that it hadn’t re-invested in new debt to effectively
“cure” the breach and ultimately then passed the tests, one of
the people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middle-market CLO managed by ArrowMark Partners, Peaks
2014-1A, breached its senior OC test. The deal has more exposure
to larger loans than typical middle-market deals. It’s the only
deal of ArrowMark’s CLOs to have breached an OC provision. A
representative for the Denver-based firm declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

For your consideration here are Hyman P. Minsky's five stages of a bubble. I believe we are firmly in the beginning to mid phase of stage 3.


**1.Displacement**

Fed is willing to pump infinite amounts of liquidity into the banking sector

Interest rates likely to stay at 0% for months or even years

Feds buying junk bonds therefore few if any blue chip corporations will need to worry about liquidity

,investing,"Chipotle, Tesla near all time highs. SPY and DIA 12% off all time highs. I used to think when this first started there would be a V shaped recovery and that the virus's impact on business will not be so bad, but I changed positions in early April when oil crashed and we saw that massive unemployment was coming as well as worsening data from the virus showing the worst case outcome. The unemployment figures will change consumer spending, many people are surviving on debt right now and that debt has to get payed off -  instead of buying new cars and going on vacation spending will be much more modest.

Yet the market shrugs it off. If everything is going up because of where earnings will be 2-3 years from now my questions are:

1. If there is this much confidecne in the future why not value companies at what they will earn 10-20-50 years from now? Why do stocks go down at all if ""future earnings will always be better""? Thats been the market behavior for the last decade.
2. Its hard enough to predict where earnings will be next quarter, why are we seeing trading based on where things are expected to be 2 years from now? How can anyone make any investment decisions with any accuracy, seems like there are a lot of assumptions taking place that are not following the fundamanetal data, or I am missing something.
3. Things are NOT CHEAP anymore, they were the last 2 weeks of March relative to the last few years. If people shrug off the bad news now, why didn't they back then when nothing is really different and we already saw that what happened in China has spread globally. Why are people buying Tesla now at 900 when it was 350 a month ago?
4. I thought at around SPY 250 we would turn around to test the lows again but its been straight up at a 45 degree angle. There is an arguement saying that the crash already happened and thats why everything is rebounding. Okay great, the bottom is in but the economy is different and worse than a lot of people expected. With oil remaining this low the shale economic boom we've enjoyed for the last 10 years is over and all of those companies can't turn a profit and will lay off a couple hundred thousand people at least. ""So what, stocks only go up"" doesn't seem like the responsible behavior.
5. Earnings right now are NOT GOOD, most have had a full Q1 and have barely had any time for the economic shutdown to affect them. Most are also giving no guidance saying they don't know how things will be. Stocks go up.
6. A headline declaring ""the economy is reopoening"" doesn't mean everyone will suddenly fill up movie theatres like before and start going on vacation. Many people living with elderly family will still be cautious through  the rest of the year if not indefinately until there is a vaccine  and hanging out at a bar while maintaining 6 feet of social distancing isn't going to be the same as before.

Do you think the market is overly optimistic on returning back to normal? If not, what are we missing and failing to understand? Why are we so close to all time highs? US markets exchange $168 billion a day. The fed adding $5 billion to that per day, mostly in treasuries, is a drop in the bucket no?

&lt;li&gt;If there is this much confidecne in the future why not value companies at what they will earn 10-20-50 years from now? Why do stocks go down at all if &amp;quot;future earnings will always be better&amp;quot;? Thats been the market behavior for the last decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its hard enough to predict where earnings will be next quarter, why are we seeing trading based on where things are expected to be 2 years from now? How can anyone make any investment decisions with any accuracy, seems like there are a lot of assumptions taking place that are not following the fundamanetal data, or I am missing something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things are NOT CHEAP anymore, they were the last 2 weeks of March relative to the last few years. If people shrug off the bad news now, why didn&amp;#39;t they back then when nothing is really different and we already saw that what happened in China has spread globally. Why are people buying Tesla now at 900 when it was 350 a month ago?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I thought at around SPY 250 we would turn around to test the lows again but its been straight up at a 45 degree angle. There is an arguement saying that the crash already happened and thats why everything is rebounding. Okay great, the bottom is in but the economy is different and worse than a lot of people expected. With oil remaining this low the shale economic boom we&amp;#39;ve enjoyed for the last 10 years is over and all of those companies can&amp;#39;t turn a profit and will lay off a couple hundred thousand people at least. &amp;quot;So what, stocks only go up&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t seem like the responsible behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings right now are NOT GOOD, most have had a full Q1 and have barely had any time for the economic shutdown to affect them. Most are also giving no guidance saying they don&amp;#39;t know how things will be. Stocks go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A headline declaring &amp;quot;the economy is reopoening&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t mean everyone will suddenly fill up movie theatres like before and start going on vacation. Many people living with elderly family will still be cautious through  the rest of the year if not indefinately until there is a vaccine  and hanging out at a bar while maintaining 6 feet of social distancing isn&amp;#39;t going to be the same as before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think the market is overly optimistic on returning back to normal? If not, what are we missing and failing to understand? Why are we so close to all time highs? US markets exchange $168 billion a day. The fed adding $5 billion to that per day, mostly in treasuries, is a drop in the bucket no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorting doesn&amp;#39;t work - longing seems irresponsible, but doing nothing makes no returns. Whats the plan? &lt;/p&gt;

The majority of the world’s wealthiest investors are waiting for stocks to drop further before buying again, on concerns about the pandemic’s impact on the global economy, according to a poll by UBS Global Wealth Management.

Among the surveyed investors and business owners with at least US$1 million in investable assets or in annual revenue, 61 per cent want to see equities fall another five per cent to 20 per cent before buying, while 23 per cent say it’s already a good time to do so. Some 16 per cent say that now is not the time to load up on stocks as it’s a bear market.

High net-worth individuals are cautious on risk assets as 60 per cent say a global recession is highly likely to occur in the next 12 months, the April poll by UBS showed. Still, they remain largely positive about the long-term outlook

Gilead Announces Results From Phase 3 Trial of Investigational Antiviral Remdesivir in Patients With Severe COVID-19

April 29, 2020 at 8:35 AM EDT [**PDF Version**](http://investors.gilead.com/node/36871/pdf)

***-- Study Demonstrates Similar Efficacy with 5- and 10-Day Dosing Durations of Remdesivir --***

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 29, 2020-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from the open-label, Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease. The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 \[95% CI 0.51 – 1.12\] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.

“Unlike traditional drug development, we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving global pandemic. Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 and how to best utilize the drug,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “These study results complement data from the placebo-controlled study of remdesivir conducted by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and help to determine the optimal duration of treatment with remdesivir. The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir. This is particularly important in the setting of a pandemic, to help hospitals and healthcare workers treat more patients in urgent need of care.”

Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.

In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5 percent (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8 percent (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery.

Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7 percent (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64 percent (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61 percent (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.

**Impact of Earlier Treatment**

In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62 percent of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital, compared with 49 percent of patients who were treated late.

“These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective.”

Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10 percent of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3 percent (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0 percent (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.

Key efficacy and safety results from the study are included in the table below.

**About the SIMPLE Trials**

Gilead initiated two randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials for remdesivir, the SIMPLE studies, in countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

The first SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing regimens of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. The initial phase of the study randomized 397 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on the first day, followed by remdesivir 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, administered intravenously, in addition to standard of care. An expansion phase of the study was recently added and will enroll an additional 5,600 patients, including patients on mechanical ventilation. The study is being conducted at 180 trial sites around the world, including sites in the United States, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.

And I think it's a discussion worth having, since I can't seem to paint a picture that isn't horrific for the EU (and especially Southern Europe). As I have at most marginal knowledge in this field, please read the bullet points as my train of thought.

**Pre COVID-19 situation:**

* ECB interest rate at 0.0% interest since 2016
* ECB buying up debt ever since the Eurocrisis
* Debt to GDP ratio: France, Spain, Belgium nearing 100%; Italy 130%
* In the best of times, aforementioned countries could barely make a dent in paying back their debt
* Saving grace is that the yield is very low and even negative on short term bonds.
* Ageing population and high youth unemployment

**COVID-19 situation:**

* Spain, Italy, France most hit areas. As a result, they had to implement the most restrictive lockdowns seen in the West. Industry at standstill. GDP likely contracting \~8-10% or more on average for these countries.
* ECB buying up debt, securities and everything in between.
* Northern European countries very reluctant to implement low yield eurobonds, as this would increase interest on their respective outstanding debts and would be electoral suicide. Meanwhile southern European countries see anti EU sentiments lighting up again due to receiving a cold shower from their Northern counterparts.

**The future**

* Countries like Spain, Italy (and to a lesser extent), France would need to keep existing social safety nets buoyant while seeing massive increases in unemployment and business foreclosures.
* Stimulus money is needed to jumpstart the economy
* These countries will bury themselves into deeper debt levels.
* ECB has less room to manoeuvre than FED, and even less after QEing and keeping interest rates low for years.

I can only see 2 outcomes in this: 1) Some kind of EU reconciliation. Northern European countries will be forced to service South European debts for decades to come (Eurobonds or some other mechanism) at knifepoint (i.e. otherwise face imminent depression or EU collapse). This will increase the role of the EU and diminishing the power and role of individual member states for good. This will leave the Northern European countries weaker and more indebted 2) Spain and Italy will truly be stagnant for decades to come, making the future of the EU uncertain due to anti EU sentiment.

The challenge, he suggested, is that most of us only download and shop from a handful of native apps, so it can be hard for an independent brand to launch an app of their own.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of good things are happening with Shopify right now but are the valuations justified. How could one arrive at a fair valuation considering they are not even profitable yet?&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"TLDR: Tick tock, we’re living in a simulation that will come to an end sooner or later.

Opinion: **We should all come to the conclusion that Trump sees the stock market’s success as the true picture of our economy.** 

That being said, as far as I know the election isn’t until November (7 months from now). 

If the market tanked in a matter of weeks, why wouldn’t the FED be able to again just pick up all the pieces once more should it happen all over again. You can’t all be seriously thinking we’ll hit ATH in the next week or two and sustain that till November and beyond. 

Let’s be real, Trumps buddies got smacked, he gave them a helping hand and now they’re in a prime position to short the market and make their money all over again. Trump can be the hero once more. 

Yes the recovery won’t be V shaped, so it’ll be booming after a “healthy drop.” Every figure, every analyst, every projection is looking for some kind of pullback. 

Even bullish investors I follow are starting to get confused. Yes this isn’t 2008, but even back in January everyone and their mother was screaming that stocks were overvalued. 

Now with a global pandemic, unemployment at record highs, stimulus for everyone, GDP contraction at great depression levels, and we’re all of a sudden back?? It’s just not healthy, PERIOD. It’s not sustainable. Q2 numbers are expected to be shit. Everyone’s guidance is basically pulled. And look at the markets reaction last week when news broke out that Gileads drug could be a flop.. it spooked! 

Things are running on very thin rope here and I personally see the risk/reward for long positions at this moment pretty low. That’s not to say we won’t run up another 5, 10, 20% who knows.. we’re currently living a simulation.. but if the hammer should fall, it’ll likely fall hard.. maybe it’ll be similar to the 2010 flash crash. Who knows.

[Southwest Airlines](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/southwest-airlines) lost $144 million before taxes during the first three months of the year as the elimination of non-essential travel aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 brought business to a grinding halt.

Now onto their financials/financial history:
Quarter after quarter they are beating expectations. The coronavirus did not affect them one bit. Their market cap is currently over 35 billion dollars &amp; their current revenue is at $1.4billion and just a quick 5yr max search of their stock will show you that their stocks have done nothing but CONSISTENTLY go up. 

Even better fellas, lots of analysts forecast this company to be at $400 by the end of the year, but with this past week's earnings call, they're set to exceed $400 share price by this summer.

&lt;p&gt;So now that I have set their foundation, these madlads started exploring the technology aspects in health. Their machines are genuinely the best in the business.

&lt;p&gt;Their flagship device is a non-intrusive Continuous Glucose monitoring. They&amp;#39;re partnered with some of the best tech companies in order to create powerful real time displays of your vitals on your phone, laptop &amp;amp; best yet, APPLE WATCH.

&lt;p&gt;Now onto their financials/financial history:
Quarter after quarter they are beating expectations. The coronavirus did not affect them one bit. Their market cap is currently over 35 billion dollars &amp;amp; their current revenue is at $1.4billion and just a quick 5yr max search of their stock will show you that their stocks have done nothing but CONSISTENTLY go up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better fellas, lots of analysts forecast this company to be at $400 by the end of the year, but with this past week&amp;#39;s earnings call, they&amp;#39;re set to exceed $400 share price by this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

Because markets are getting enthusiastic with the recent news of the Covid-treatment trials of Remdesivir, it would be worthwhile to get some numbers of the time and investment it would take Gilead to scale up production of the drug. The conclusions could be also interesting to anticipate how markets will react to further Remdesivir news. I tried to find some reliable numbers in respect to the dosage of Remdesivir and put these into context of a full-fledged drug production.

In one source i've found the following about the dosage of Remdesivir, but i'm not sure if this applies in absolute terms for Covid-19 treatments.

**Dosage**

The dosing [regimen](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5278) under study in the U.S. for RDV is as follows:

* An initial one-time dose of 200mg
* Followed by 100mg per day for 10 days

Remdesivir is administered intravenously by injection.

The drug is stored in small vials (a 20ml), which contain 100mg Remdesivir as lyophilized powder. Each vial with 100mg Remdesivir powder is reconstituted with 19 mL of sterile water for injection and diluted into intravenous infusion fluids prior to intravenous administration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Calculating production volume and demand**

I recall reading that Remdesivir is more effective in early treatment, hence on a sidenote a widely spread testing regime seems to be crucial here.

Assuming Remdesivir would be administered to 80% of infected patients at least for 5 days (recent study indirectly suggested 5 day treatment may be sufficient) and 20% of patients for at least 10 days (due to age, complications, etc.), and assuming (for the sake of having a starting point) there is a million patients every 3 months... the following calculations would apply

800000 patients x (200mg + (5days x 100mg)) = 560.000.000mg

200000 patients x (200mg + (10days x 100mg) = 240.000.000mg

800.000.000mg / 100mg (one vial) = 8.000.000 vials

Considering shipment to 4000 hospitals worldwide (the US has about 6000 hospitals) for one month and equally distributed volumes of Remdesivir, about 650 vials would be available to each hospital for a month, which is sufficient to treat between 54 to 92 patients monthly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns on production**

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/03/26/problem-remdesivir-making-it-14665](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/03/26/problem-remdesivir-making-it-14665)

It appears that Remdesivir is quite difficult to produce, hence its high cost. More info in above article. The remdesivir sequence consists of five reactions, and the difficult part is to ensure a high enough yield in each of these reactions. The process seems to be labour and time intensive.

**questions**

How much time would it take to build up one or several lab production line(s) able to make 8million Remdesivir vials every quarter?

How many patients each quarter would one need to anticipate globally, when lockdowns are lifted?

Regardless of the details considering various models it appears to be a huge undertaking.",t2_40341tvn,False,,0,False,How many months would it take to massively scale up production of Gilead's Remdesivir?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_gads6p,False,dark,0.71,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,1588186543.0,,[],{},,True,,1588210746.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[EDIT: ADDED HOSPITAL DISTRIBUTION NUMBERS &amp;amp; CONCERN ABOUT PRODUCTION CHALLENGES]&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"First off let me say thank you for everyone in this sub(s), I’ve learned so much from it.

I'm planning on making a shift from purely stocks/options portfolio to 80/20 mix of ETFs and growth stocks.  Maybe like a second account altogether. I’m 31 so my thinking is mostly to buy/hold, not to actively trade. Here are my possible ETF selections.

1. VOO (instead of SPY because of expense ratio [https://stockanalysis.com/what-is-the-best-sp500-etf/](https://stockanalysis.com/what-is-the-best-sp500-etf/)). Or Just go in different direction with VUG ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/VUG-vs-VOO](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/VUG-vs-VOO))
2. VTI (Total market exposure comparison with VOO [https://stockanalysis.com/voo-vs-vti/](https://stockanalysis.com/voo-vs-vti/)). I’m in between VTI or just go in a different direction with Small cap like VB/VBK or SLYV
3. QQQ (Because of non tech companies, NASDAQ 100 and also its popularity)
4. VXUS (International market exposure). I also found VIGI I have to do some research which one's better
5. FTEC (Technology sector)-I thought this is better compared to XLK ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/XLK-vs-FTEC](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/XLK-vs-FTEC)). But I’m not sure if VGT is better ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/FTEC-vs-VGT](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/FTEC-vs-VGT))
6. ICLN (Clean energy). TAN is another option but its focus is on Solar ([https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34976n/buying\_tan\_and\_icln/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34976n/buying_tan_and_icln/))
7. XLE (Energy sector). I know this is in downtrend so this won’t be a long term hold like the others.
8. JETS (Airlines)
9. VNQ (REITs) I haven't done any research on this one though ([https://www.thebalance.com/best-reit-etfs-4174043](https://www.thebalance.com/best-reit-etfs-4174043))

There are so many other categories like emerging markets(VWO,EEM etc., developed markets(EFA,VEA etc.), sector wise like XLF(finance) and specialized ones like GLD (Gold),BND (Bond market) and so many categories ( and sub categories through a bunch of providers. What I haven't nailed down is what percentages is like a safe bet and of course for DCA'ing going forward.

There are couple sectors I think are good but not sure if I'd want them on my long term portfolio: Defense (ITA), manufacturing (FIDU for example). Want to hear your opinions on these. I guess we can replace REITs with either one of these if the returns/growth is good.

I have no idea how 3X leveraged ETFs/indexes like SOXL, SQQQ etc. work. But I want to see what do you think of having a balance ETF to these (like VIIX for example) in case of market downs. Is SQQQ a good one to hang on to or no?

What I'm planning to do is to have about 6-8 of these ETFs and maybe 3-4 blue-chip stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN etc. What I'm conflicted is this seems redundant as these 4 stocks usually makeup couple (or more) of the above mentioned ETFs. I'm hoping for some suggestions here.

I think it's hard to keep track of stocks if you own too many. I mean there's so many debates on how many is too many. I want to see what you guys think.

(Bloomberg) -- Hudson’s Bay Co. missed April payments on
two commercial mortgage-backed securities that were part of $696 million in financing for Saks Fifth Avenue and other stores.
The securities, originated in 2015, were current until this
month when the company missed interest-only debt payments
totaling $3.2 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
and a person familiar with the matter.

HBC spokeswoman Nicole Schoenberg declined to comment.
The missed payments in the HBC debt portfolio were on
securities that financed 34 properties - 10 Saks and 24 Lord &amp;
Taylor stores. The Saks locations include Beverly Hills,
California, Atlanta, Chicago and Miami.

HBC operates retail stores, which have been hit hard by
social-distancing guidelines that have frozen much the economies
in the U.S. and Canada. Department stores were facing financial
challenges even before being forced to close, as shoppers
increasingly embraced the convenience of e-commerce. Now, those problems are getting worse.

Macy’s Inc., which has furloughed workers and shuttered
stores, is exploring a rescue financing deal to shore up its
liquidity. Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. missed payments on some

I have the algo also keeping track of Covid-19 related headlines and running it daily vs the SP500. Plotting the results of the past months gives some interesting insight in how sentiment of headlines has evolved over time vs movements of the SP500.

I was looking at some [research](https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/) about the emerging markets, and when I saw the graph of the US dollar, the cycles were pretty obvious.

,investing,"Analysts at Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

1. In China, 2020 light vehicle production is projected to decline 5% to 12.5% y/y, according to rating agencies and industry sources. However, the auto market there is recovering, with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers returning to pre-pandemic levels. By end of March, auto plants in China are operating at 97% capacity vs. 60% in February.
2. On the demand side, country-wide return-to-work appears to be strengthening consumer confidence and demand for vehicles. Adding to that demand are federal + regional stimulus programs for electric vehicles. Multiple Chinese cities have also relaxed restrictions on license plates for EVs (such restrictions have been used as a measure to manage congestion). However, total units are expected to still be below 2019 and 2018.
3. Behavioral wise, Chinese consumers have shifted more towards private vehicles to avoid shared vehicles (benefit to auto demand), but they're also leaving their homes less and have grown more accustomed to delivery (headwind to auto demand).
4. $TSLA has been by far the leader in China's EV market, selling 12k Model 3 alone in March, well ahead of second place BYD (sold 5k EVs), BAIC (4.5k), and BMW 5 Series PHEV and Ford Escape PHEV lagging behind (under 3k). Including both luxury EVs and non-EVs, Tesla was the 2nd best selling in the country after Mercedes C-Class, but the clear leader in Tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen). Chinese consumers also have a tendency to discount Chinese brands vs. global brands.
5. Caution against using China as a benchmark for recovery timeline in EU/US. China was able to flatten the curve and recover in 4-6 weeks due to its integrated coding system that identifies every person that needs to be quarantined based on their mobility patterns. Such an invasive surveillance system is not possible in EU/US. EU is past the 6-8 week mark and there's yet to be a recovery.

,investing,"Last night I was thinking about how the world economy is re-opening, and that pretty much across the world, the economies will be re-opening in stages. It seems that everywhere the first stage will be to open at a limited capacity. Speaking with a few restaurateurs in the last few days, They are concerned that opening at 25%/50%/75% capacity will allow them to cover their fixed costs until we go back to normal. 

So that got me thinking, how can these folks stay over water over the next few months? Then it dawned on me: Raising prices of their products wouldn't seem that far fetched. Despite demand dropping considerably over the next few months, supply would also be low (There will be establishments never re-opening + limited capacity rules = low supply). 

I continued down this rabbit hole of thought, and realized that maybe, there are some inflationary pressures lingering, but I haven't seen much talk of them. Here's some inflationary actions that I identified:

1. The one above. Establishments raising prices to stay afloat. 

2. Direct stimulus from all governments, both in forms of free money (Expanded EI) and cheap lending. 

3. Gas being at a near all time low. 

4. [This one is more meta] - The enormous amounts of marketing both from governments and corporations towards the consumer. I have a feeling that there will be a never-before-seen push to spend once things are more clear.

,investing,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

Here are my two-cents as a middle-market private equity investor; it's an interesting perch to watch things unfolding real-time... and which frankly makes me wonder WTH is going on in the public markets. I'm not going to edit this for typos.

**Earnings:** Our investments are relatively resilient (think trains, pharmacies, food supply chain stuff). But our earnings are getting absolutely smoked; I'm talking (20%) to (30%) territory. Our Q1 valuations won't really reflect this as March will have some China noise and 2 weeks of lockdown (the majority of American businesses will feel this on the margin), but Q2 and Q3 will be a mess... for us, we mark-to-market and carry on; but the hit on earnings poses a big covenant and liquidity issue.

In the public sphere, mark-to-market *is* the market. I can only interpret the market as saying your NTM earnings, however risky and unknown (this is without precedent, after all), are irrelevant because the long-term story holds water. Since when did the public markets move from being so short-term and hung up on quarterly earnings to so long-term? I'm lost.

**Refi wall**: Private companies went into Covid-19 with historically levered balance sheets. Granted, a lot of issuances were cov light at higher leverage levels, some are HY and are trading like shit, but even the best private loan terms have fixed charge covenants which will bite borrowers in the ass. There's about $1.5tn of corporate loans maturing over the next 12 months (what we call a refi wall). When that wall hits, companies will be refinancing off of significantly lower earnings (best case) or will be trying to find debt in a market that's seized (which is what we saw in 2009).

Imagine you earned $100mm of EBITDA and you were 4x levered heading into Covid. Now it's time to refinance, and your EBITDA is $75mm; you'd be looking to fill a 5x of hole on your balance sheet, and no one is lending at those levels any time soon. Sure, some businesses won't be down (25%), but a lot of industrial, old-world, cyclical businesses will be - and then some.

If you're a PE-backed company, you call in your best lending relationships and add some equity to fill the hole (or you say F it). If you're a SMB, I have to imagine you just throw in the towel. What other option do you have?

Government stimulus has been a huge boost on this front, but marginal credit heading into Covid-19 will be unfinanceable and businesses will go under en masse, whether it's a liquidity crunch today or an inability to refi tomorrow.

**Farm crisis**: I don't know why it doesn't get more media attention, but there's a storm brewing in the food supply chain. Granted, these points are hearsay, but we have it on pretty good authority that commercial farms will soon be forced to euthanize entire herds of livestock and poultry. The reality is that cows, chickens, and pigs get too old and too fat quickly, and when processors are shut down, there isn't a lot of time to spare. That's the protein story.

Produce could also face issues. Again, hearsay, but we've heard that some crops aren't going in during prime planting season. You might already be seeing the food supply chain - particularly truck - screwing things up (noticed any fresh produce missing from the menu of your grocery store or current take-out spot?), but if there's a fundamental supply issue it would spell serious trouble. You thought fighting over the last roll of toilet paper was bad?

I would love to be fact-checked on this front. Again, it's coming from sources in the thick of things, but it's quite ominous when food security in North America is a topic of discussion.

**O&amp;G**: The fracking boom has been a massive driver of employment over the last decade or so. As wells shut off, people will be sent home. I don't think I need to go into this more, but too much or too little oil are both huge issues for America.

**Credit cards &amp; other consumer debt**: This one has been getting a bit more traction as the value investor blogs have been all over it. Let's say we are back to normal in a few weeks or months time. And people are now able to go out and start spending again. Notwithstanding the fact that unemployment is insane (26mm?!) and it will take time for those people to re-enter the workforce, there will be a mountain of backdated credit card, mortgage, car, rent, and other loan payments they'll need to service before they buy that BBQ, renovate their house, or take a trip.

What card do you guys think the government has up its sleeve to gloss over that? I'm a family of four and I don't want the banks to foreclose on my house (obviously) or my car (to get to work); do we honestly think there's much left over after all that debt service? Maybe mass consumer loan forgiveness or refinancing (i.e., tack missed payments onto the end of the loan). I just haven't seen it.

Someone tell me everything above is wrong and I'm just seeing problems where solutions are in the works. I just can't make sense of everything I'm seeing - earnings getting smashed, lenders getting picky, fundamental supply and demand issues - next to a market that's modestly down (relatively) from record-highs. Am I missing something?",t2_68l2fwzf,False,,0,False,PE investor perch: Help me make sense of the s-storm we're seeing in real-time,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_g9qibl,False,dark,0.9,,public,58,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,58,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588120479.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-time lurker, first-time poster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my two-cents as a middle-market private equity investor; it&amp;#39;s an interesting perch to watch things unfolding real-time... and which frankly makes me wonder WTH is going on in the public markets. I&amp;#39;m not going to edit this for typos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earnings:&lt;/strong&gt; Our investments are relatively resilient (think trains, pharmacies, food supply chain stuff). But our earnings are getting absolutely smoked; I&amp;#39;m talking (20%) to (30%) territory. Our Q1 valuations won&amp;#39;t really reflect this as March will have some China noise and 2 weeks of lockdown (the majority of American businesses will feel this on the margin), but Q2 and Q3 will be a mess... for us, we mark-to-market and carry on; but the hit on earnings poses a big covenant and liquidity issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the public sphere, mark-to-market &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the market. I can only interpret the market as saying your NTM earnings, however risky and unknown (this is without precedent, after all), are irrelevant because the long-term story holds water. Since when did the public markets move from being so short-term and hung up on quarterly earnings to so long-term? I&amp;#39;m lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refi wall&lt;/strong&gt;: Private companies went into Covid-19 with historically levered balance sheets.

,investing,"Hi All,

First of all, I’m a data scientist by profession but a history major by training. So I’ve tried to cite all relevant data points with a (&lt;source&gt;) tag. This allows us to separate debating the data vs. the analysis. I’m also a complete newbie to real estate investing. One of the main goals in fact of this post is to organize my thoughts so far and solicit feedback from more knowledgable individuals. 


As part of a balanced portfolio, I've invested passively in real estate for several years (both public REITs and a small amount in a private platform). As my assets have grown and I'm entering the age to buy a primary residence, I've been trying to educate myself on the housing real estate market. After all, even if you don't own any investment properties the purchase of a home is the largest single financial transaction you'll likely ever make. In fact, if you look at the chart linked below (1, see Sources below) you'll see housing is the single largest asset for households with net worth below 1 million dollars, i.e. ~90% of Americans (2). In fact, even in 2010 (in the midst of the Great Financial Crisis): ""The primary residence represented 62% of the median homeowner’s total assets and 42% of the median home owner’s wealth"" (3).  In fact, reading the Economist recently (obviously in my slippers) I was surprised to discover housing is the world's largest asset class. This HSBC report (avoiding the Economist paywall) cites housing as a $226 trillion (!) asset class at the end of 2016 (4) out of a total net worth in 2018 of ~$360 trillion according to Credit Suisse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even with my casual research, it's clear that real estate is divided into multiple segments including residential, commercial, industrial, farm land, etc. Even the subsector of residential is divided into single family, multi-family, commercial, mobile homes, etc. These segments are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. So far I’ve limited my research to the US residential sector: single family homes, multifamily, and small commercial apartment buildings. Therefore moving forward when I say real estate I will limit the scope to the above US residential housing market, i.e. acquiring individual or personal portfolio of US housing properties. 

&amp;nbsp;



More formally, the purpose of my analysis below is: 

* Understand my options as it pertains to real estate. E.g. is it better to consider “house hacking”, i.e. buying a primary residence and several investment units as part of a duplex, triplex, etc. 
* Avoid making obvious mistakes in the purchase of my primary home

* To summarize what I’ve learned and start to develop opinion about real estate investing more broadly as a complement to public equities investing

* Broaden my knowledge professionally (my clients include large real estate companies) 

* Learn from the community! 

Note: I considered posting this in /r/realestateinvesting, but ultimately my goal is to evaluate real estate vs. other asset classes. Obviously some people will simply prefer real estate for a variety of reasons, but personally my goal is to achieve the greatest return for the least risk and work. I should stress that I love my career (data scientist) and have no intention of quitting, so the last point is particularly important. 

&amp;nbsp;


**Analysis**

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that immediately strikes me as an investor accustomed to public securities, e.g. bonds / stocks, is how odd the real estate market (in particular housing) is in comparison. Having a margin account from a broker, i.e. getting leverage, is often a difficult process reserved for “advanced” investors. In residential real estate, it’s considered “conservative” for an individual to have leverage of 4-5 to 1 (FHA loans, for example, only require 3.5% down in some cases!) . What’s even crazier is that the loan is often issued at only 2-4% over the 10 year US treasury rate.  For example today, April 26th, the 10 year treasure is 0.606% while NerdWallet has a rate of 3.3% for a prime credit score, single family home, primary residence 30 year loan. 



&amp;nbsp;


Perhaps because real estate is the only avenue available for newer investors to take on large amounts leverage immediately, I've seen extreme and, in my opinion, irrational positions on the subject. Even a cursory glance at BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. uncovers multiple posts along the lines of either  ""real estate investing is the best investment ever!"" vs. ""the real estate market is a massive bubble and will crash soon"". I've summarized a few of the common tropes I've seen below with my analysis.


&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a huge bubble, and is going to collapse any day!

As noted above, real estate / housing has numerous segments that are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. Saying that ""real estate"" will crash is like saying the “food industry” will crash. What segment and where? US soybean growers? Fast Food? Argentinian ranchers?  McDonalds in particular? 

Limiting our discussion to US housing: the Case-Shiller national price index (7) shows that home prices dropped ~27% from peak to trough in the Great Financial Crisis over a period of  almost 6 years (Mid 2006 to early 2012). The reason this was such a catastrophic event is that housing had never decreased nationally in a significant way before in the modern era (see Case Schiller home price index). Of course, it’s worth noting that housing had rarely increased rapidly against inflation before. 

Let’s assume we had an equivalent event occur. The Jan 2020 index was at 212, so home prices would decrease by 27% to ~155 (mid 2008 levels). Crucially though, this price drop would be expected to play out for years! During that time vested interests (more on that later) would lobby governments extensively for support, foreign and US investors could form funds to take advantage of the situation, etc. As a reference point there is ~$1.5 trillion available in US private equity funds alone as of January 2020. 

However, it is worth pointing out that this is at the national level. Local real estate markets, particularly those dependent on select industries or foreign investors, could easily see more dramatic price movements. The US census has a really cool chart (22) that shows the inflation adjusted (as of year 2000) median home values every decade by state from 1940 to 2000. We see that Minnesota home values actually dropped from $105,000 in 1980 to $94,500 in 1990, a fall of more than 10%. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Everyone needs a place to live, therefore housing can never go down

Everyone needs a place to eat, but restaurants and grocery stores are famously low margin businesses (5). Farms supply an even more basic need, but many go bankrupt (6). The question isn’t whether housing will go down or not, but whether it will return an attractive rate of return compared to alternative investments. 

It’s also worth pointing out that for most “retail” US housing real estate investors, they are investing in a narrow geographic area. Migration and births/ deaths can play a huge role in the need for housing in a given area. Case in point, NYC may have actually begun losing population to migration in 2017 / 2018 (23). Even more interesting, NYC has experienced a substantial loss due to domestic migration which is almost balanced by foreign immigration / new births (24). If foreign immigration decreases in the post-COVID we would expect NYC’s population to decline more rapidly given current trends. 

It is entirely possible for national housing prices to modestly increase while expensive coastal markets decline significantly, for example. 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; It's supply and demand. There's a nationwide housing shortage so prices can only go up! 

This one has some factual basis. Freddie Mac put out a study in Feb 2020 (18) which indicated that there is a shortage of housing units between 2.5 - 3.3 million units. Some interesting notes about this study is that they consider the “missing” household formation and extrapolate interstate migration trends. As noted below, the US builds ~1.3 million housing units a year, so this reflects ~2 years of housing construction. It’s also worth noting the geographic variation, with “high growth” states like Massachusetts, California, Colorado, etc. seeing ~5% housing deficits vs. states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc. seeing housing surpluses of ~2-4%. 

However, a Zillow analysis on our aging population (11) points to a slightly different conclusion. Based on their analysis, an additional ~190,000 home will be released by seniors between 2017-2027 compared to 2007-2017. That number increases by another 250,000 homes annually between 2027-2037. Combined, this is about ~50% of the average annual homes constructed in the US between 2000-2009 at ~900,000. 

Given these slightly conflicting reports, let’s get back to basics. First, let's separate housing into single family homes, multi-family units, and large apartment buildings. Single family homes, particularly near dense and economically vibrant metros, are far more supply constrained. In contrast, multi family units / apartment towers are, barring regulatory issues (see California), less constrained by available land. See Hudson Yards in NYC, the Seaport area in Boston, the Wharf in DC, etc. It's worth noting that due to costs / market demand most of these developments cater to the entry level luxury category and above, but they are new supply. 

I actually wound up looking at US Census projections to get a sense of the long term outlook. By 2030 the Census estimates the population will grow from 334.5 million to 359.4, for a total increase of 24.9 million or an annual increase of 2.49 million (8). In 2019 the Census estimated 888,000 private single family units and 403,000 units in buildings w/ 2+ units were constructed for a grand total of 1,291,000 units (9). The average number of people per US household is 2.52 (10). Some simple math suggests that if we assume each new single family home contains the average number of Americans and each apartment conservatively contains only a single person we get 888,000 * 2.52 + 403,000 = ~2.64 million. 


Now, talking about averages in a national real estate market reminds me of a joke about Mars: on average it's a balmy 72 degrees. But the point still stands that at a high level, theoretical sense there is sufficient  ""housing"" for the US population. The question, as always, is at what price and location? 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a safer investment than the stock market!

This one honestly irritates me. While there are many advantages to real estate I can see, safety is not one of them. It is a highly leveraged, illiquid, extremely concentrated asset when bought individually (i.e not in a REIT). Let’s use an example here. Is there a financial advisoy in the world who would recommend you put your entire investment portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway? Of course not, diversification is the bedrock of modern personal finance. And yet Berkshire Hathaway is an extremely diversified asset manager with well run and capitalized companies ranging from Geico to Berkshire Homes to Berkshire Energy. Oh, and it also has $130 billion (with a B) in cash equivalents. 

I honestly think this impression stems from 3 factors: 

* Almost all asset prices have gone up (barring a few 1-2 month downturns) for 10+ years. There was also a shortage of skilled labor, capital, etc. that dramatically reduced the new supply of housing
* Survivorship bias. The people who fail in real estate tend to limp away quietly. The ones who survive and succeed tout their success loudly. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; You won’t build your wealth in the stock market

One common theme I’m already noticing listening to podcasts, reading blogs, etc. is that many people started investing in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis (2009 - 2011). And, in retrospect, it was clearly a great time to buy property! But it was also a great time it turns out to buy almost every investment. 

I plugged in the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 from December 2009 to December 2019 with dividends reinvested (and ignoring the 15-20% long term tax on dividends) (12). It was 13.3%. If you managed to buy at the market bottom of Feb 2009 it was 15.8%! 

The long term annual average of the S&amp;P 500 from 1926 - 2018 is ~10-11% (with dividends reinvested). (13). The S&amp;P has never lost money in a 30 year period with dividends reinvested, see the fantastic book Stocks for the Long Run (14). In fact, if you’re investing before 30 the worst 35 year period (i.e. when you would turn 65) is 6.1% (15). 

Housing, in general, has tracked at or slightly above inflation ( 16). Even a click bait CNBC article (17) about “skyrocketing” home prices states that homes are rising 2x as fast as inflation (i.e. ~4%). If you look at the CNBC chart for inflation adjusted prices, you’ll see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% from 1940 to 2000. Let’s do this same exercise again with the Average Sales Price of Homes from Fred (i.e. Fed economic data) (18). In Q1 1963 the average sales price of a house was $19,300. In Q4 2019 it was $382,300. That is a CAGR of ~5.38% over ~57 years. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that while real estate does have some tax advantages, there are also property taxes, maintenance, etc. 

But it’s harder than that. Because real estate is an illiquid asset. In general, illiquid assets require higher returns than 
the equivalent liquid asset because of the inconvenience / risk of not having the ability to transact frequently. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Case study of real estate purchase:**

I’d like to focus the rest of my analysis on an area that many members of BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. seem to gloss over: credit. I was surprised to see that for first time home buyers, 72% made a down payment of 6% or less according in Dec 2018 according to (27). This would imply prices only have to decrease 6% to put these new homebuyers underwater, i.e. owe more after a sale than their mortgage. But  this fails to take into account costs associated with buying a property, which are substantial at 2-5% for closing according to Zillow (28). Costs for selling a property are even more substantial, ranging from 8-10% according to Zillow (29). This means that sellers only putting down 6% could be underwater (in the sense that they couldn’t sell without providing cash during the sale) with even modest price decreases when taking into account these transactional costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


Obviously there are ways to reduce these costs, so let’s walk through a hypothetical example of the median valued home of ~$200,000. 

&amp;nbsp;


A young, first time home-buyer puts down 10%, or $20k, and takes out a mortgage for $180,000. They also pay (optimistically) closing costs of 2% for $4000. Luckily, they bought in a hot housing market and prices increased 5% (real) over the next 5 years. Their house is now worth ~$255,000. They sell their house and again, optimistically, closing costs are only 4%. This means they pay $10,200. Consequently, after netting out costs we calculate naively that they would make $255k - $10k - $4k - $200k (original purchase price of home) = $41k. Given they only invested $20k of their own money, this is a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~15.4%, which is handily above the S&amp;P 500’s average. This is the naive calculation I first made, but as we’ll see it is deeply flawed. First, let’s look at costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


WalletHub has a really nice chart that shows (conveniently) property taxes on a $205,000 home across all 50 states (30). The average American household spends $2375 on property taxes, so let’s assume a little less and go for $1500. So 5 years x $1500 = $7500. 


&amp;nbsp;


For home maintenance, the consensus seems to be ~1% annually for home maintenance with wide variation. We’ll assume that’s $2000 off the base price, so $2000 * 5 = $10,000.  (31).


&amp;nbsp;


For homeowner’s insurance, Bankrate (32) provides a nice graph that shows the average annual cost for a $300,000 dwelling across all states and then a separate chart for costs based on dwelling coverage. For a $200,000 dwelling coverage we have a figure of $1806 per year, so over 5 years we have $1800 * 5 = $9000. 


&amp;nbsp;


Finally we need to calculate the interest on the debt. One thing that I didn’t realize until I looked at an amortization table how front-loaded the interest payments are. Case in point, I plugged in the $180,000 loan into the amortization calculator (34) using a 3.5% interest rate and saw that we pay on average ~$6000 each year in interest vs. only ~$3800 to principal. 


&amp;nbsp;


**So lets’s run the new numbers.**

You sell your home still for $255,000. After 5 years, your mortgage is now ~$160000 (i.e. you paid off 20,000 over 5 years, or ~$4k per year). So after the sale  you are left with ~$95,000. The buying and selling costs remain the same as before, so we subtract the $14k for $81,000. We also then subtract $7500 (property taxes), $10,000 (home maintenance), $9000 (homeowners insurance)  which gives us $54,500.


&amp;nbsp;


We paid ~$9,700 each year in mortgage interest + principle (~6000 interest and $3700 principal). So  5 * 9700 = $48,500.

&amp;nbsp;



So, net of everything we get $255,000 - $160,000 (remaining mortgage) - $48,500 (mortgage payments over 5 years) - $14k (buying / selling costs) - $7500 (property taxes) - $10,000 (home maintenance) - $9000 (home insurance) =  $6000. And we put down $20,000 as a downpayment, for a net compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of negative $21.4%. 


&amp;nbsp;

That is truly an astounding result. We had 10x leverage on an asset that went up 5% each year for 5 years and we somehow lost money on our “investment” of a down payment? Keep in mind we also used fairly optimistic numbers (particularly home price appreciation) and didn’t factor in PMI, etc. On the flip side, this home provided shelter, i.e. you didn’t pay rent. That’s a massive “avoided” cost and I don’t mean to minimize it. But the point here is that many homebuyers I’ve spoken to fail to account for the substantial costs of home ownership and expect their primary resident to generate a substantial return. 


&amp;nbsp;


Now, of course, for real estate investing you would likely either a) hold the property for less time and attempt to flip it via forced appreciation or b) have tenants in the property. Let’s focus on b) because frankly that’s more of my interest. From what little research I’ve done flipping houses requires much more  time that’s incompatible with my day job. 


&amp;nbsp;


I went ahead and used the rental price calculator I found online at (36) to calculate the return. I used a rent of $1300 monthly, a bit lower than the average national rent of $1476 (35) because our home price was also lower than the national average. I assumed a low vacancy rate of 5%, and no other expenses beyond the ones cited above (i.e. I didn’t assume property management, higher loan interest rate, higher property taxes). 


&amp;nbsp;


The calculator spit back a 5 year internal rate of return (a metric in this case useful  to compare against the securities markets)  of 27.79% return, i.e. a profit of $63k on an initial investment of $20k. The IRR as I understand it captures the time value of money, basically accounting for when you made various returns (37). E.g if an investment over 30 years pays nothing then gives you a lump sum payment at the end that’s very different than if it pays 1/30th of that lump sum every year. It’s useful in this case for comparing against the stock market because the IRR takes all future cash flows  back to a net present value of 0, i.e. as if we invested all the money immediately. 


&amp;nbsp;


**&amp;Now let’s do some scenario modeling (originally we had 10% down, 3.5% interest rate for an IRR of ~28%):**
 
* Let’s assume we have to put down 20%:  now we have a 19% IRR
* 20% down payment and a 5.5% (instead of 3.5%) interest rate: 14.7% IRR
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year instead of 5% with 10% down payment: 20%
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year with 20% down payment: 12.65%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 10% down payment: 4.26%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 20% down payment: -1.28%

This scenario for me demonstrated a number of interesting properties. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Owning a home for even a moderate amount of time (~5 years) will likely not build substantial wealth unless there is truly massive home appreciation. The transactional costs are too high, the ongoing costs are substantial, etc. And of course I’ve neglected to include all the remodeling, furniture, etc. that every home owner I’ve met has spent money on 
* With regards to real estate investing, home price appreciation covers up a magnitude of sins, particularly if coupled with a low cost of debt. Changing nothing but the home price appreciation changes the investment from incredible (28% IRR) to about 1/2 the expected return of the S&amp;P 500 (4.26%)
* Real estate, whether investing or owning a primary residence, has limited to negative cash flow initially. The loan is amortized so that all early payments go to interest, maintenance is expensive, etc. 
* To sanity check these figures, I went and looked at the SEC filings of Invitation Homes which owns 80,000 single family homes in the US. In 2019, Invitation Homes made ~$1.764 billion on rent + other property income while spending a combine ~$730 million on property maintenance + management.(49) . That’s about ~41% of the total property income, which aligns with the rental calculator above (rent payments fo 1300 vs ~$570 for maintenance, taxes, insurance, vacancy, etc.). That honestly makes me nervous however, as Invitation Homes theoretically has the scale to centralize and minimize maintenance costs. While I could certainly substitute “sweat equity” for some repairs, it strikes me that it would be foolish to assume my costs would be lower than Invitation Homes’


&amp;nbsp;


**401k analysis**

As I mentioned above, one of the big questions around real estate investing that I rarely see asked is “is it an appreciably better investment than the alternatives”? For W2 workers, which is ~50% of private sector workers, this question becomes even more pertinent because 401ks have massive tax benefits. In fact, only 33% of US households own taxable accounts outside of a 401k, which means the vast bulk of US households either have no accounts, 38%, or own only a retirement account like a 401k, 29%, according to (39). Let’s assume we have a middle to upper middle class worker making ~70k (this puts them roughly at the 75% percentile). They want to invest, and see two options: 

* Invest $20,000 post-tax in a downpayment  on a $200,000 investment property just like in the above analysis (we’ll assume closing costs just get baked into the final net gain) 
* Invest the equivalent amount of post-tax dollars into their 401k. You can probably see where I’m going with this by the use of “post-tax”. 


&amp;nbsp;


At a salary of $70k and assuming you took the $12k standard deduction, you would still see much of your income fall into the 22% tax bracket. While certain states charge no income tax, they generally make it up in much higher sales / property taxes, so let’s also assume a 3% state income tax (40). This means that if you invest $19,500 in a 401k (the maximum in 2020) that’s equivalent to only $14,625 post-tax (because the $19,500 would be taxed ~25% before it got to you). That leaves almost $6000 when compared with the down payment figure above, which is coincidentally the exact IRA contribution limit for 2020! The math for deductions for the IRA gets painful, but we can assume a deduction of ~$1500 (i.e. 25% of 6000). Now, if your work offers an HSA it gets even better, because those contributions are tax-free even from social security (which is typically a 6.2% tax) + medicaid (1.45%). This means that if you contribute the $3500 limit, that’s equivalent to only $2300 post-tax. 


&amp;nbsp;


This is getting rather long, so for the sake of simplicity we can basically say that in lieu of putting down a $20,000 post-tax downpayment on an investment property you could instead invest $19500 + $6000 + $3500 = $29000 into the stock market. What’s more, fees for well managed 401ks through Vanguard, Schwab are often ~0.25% (i.e. $72 annually on the $29k above). 


&amp;nbsp;


If we assume the average S&amp;P 500 index returns of 10% (we’ll ignore the $72 annually in expenses and of course there are no taxes), we would see $29k compounded over 5 years = $47,809. Since we’re investing the money all immediately, this is (I believe) more or less equivalent to the IRR rate. 


&amp;nbsp;


So, what do we need to achieve to beat that return with our investment property? Well, we previously assumed a blistering 5% real home price appreciation. With inflation at ~2%, that’s a nominal 7% home price appreciation. According to both Zillow and Core logic, Idaho is the state with the fastest home appreciation values pre-COVID at ~9%. We’re essentially predicting close to this level for 5 years, which is quite rare. In August 2019, US home prices nationally were gaining ~2.6% according to (41).

Let’s plug those numbers into our rental property calculator from above. At a 10% down payment, 3.5% interest rate, and 2.6% home price appreciation we see an IRR of 18% per year. Game, set, match, real estate, right?


&amp;nbsp;


Well, sort of. Right now we are assuming optimistic projections about maintenance (1%), closing costs (2%), and selling costs (4%). What if we bump those up to the averages cited by Zillow (3% and 8%)? Uh-oh, now we’re down to 12.38%. Okay, but what if we assume rent goes up by the same amount, ~2%? Great! Now we’re back up to 14% IRR. But if we assume all the other expenses like home insurance and maintenance go up 2% a year as well, we’re back down to 11%. 


&amp;nbsp;



We could go on forever, but the point is that real estate (particularly for rental properties) are extremely sensitive to assumptions you make on a number of factors. Given the risk, illiquidity, and work involved with a real estate property I would want to see a substantially higher return than the tax advantaged, hands off 10% my 401k gives me. I didn’t even include the typical 3% match for the 401k, which would have added $2100 to the initial investment amount and increased the 5 year return to $51,272.


&amp;nbsp;



The bottom line in my mind is that for most W2 workers who have access to pre-tax investments, they should max them out first. If you’re lucky enough to be able to max out all of the above pre-tax accounts + get a 3% match (i.e. $31k total) every year, after 15 years at a 10% return you’ll have $1.2 million. In 30 years you’ll have $6.8 million. And again, keep in mind that maxing out your pre-tax accounts only “costs” you ~$20k, because that’s what you would get after taxes. And you’ll have “made” those millions without spending a single hour outside of your day job working. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Based on the above analysis and calculations, here’s what I’ve come away with as a newbie to real estate investing:**


* Real estate investing involves significant risk. Achieving high returns relies upon either significant home appreciation or accurately calculating several key inputs (rental rates, maintenance costs, etc.). The past decades strong home appreciation has likely saved some investors from faulty assumptions, simply because their highly leveraged investment increased in value
* Given the significant transaction, maintenance, tax, and other costs simply buying and living in a single family home is not guaranteed to build substantial wealth in the short term (i.e. &lt; 10 years) even with significant price appreciation. 
* The story of real estate investing is really the story of credit availability. Low interest rates, widespread credit, etc. allow investors to take on significant leverage and potentially achieve high returns. On the flip side, if credit tightens we could see substantial movements in real estate as valuations adjust to the more expensive or less available leverage 
* Personally, I would want to see at least 12+% returns annually before I invested in real estate directly vs. a diversified stock portfolio. Potentially having a cash flow negative, illiquid, highly leveraged asset is a risk that I want to be compensated for by a higher return. Obviously there are many advantages to real estate I’ve not yet learned in depth about (e.g. taxes), so perhaps this premium will change slightly in my mind in the future
* If you’re a younger, W2 wage earning in the US with the access and ability to contribute to a 401k, IRA, and HSA you should do that first before even considering real estate investing. The tax advantages are immense, the time investment is essentially nothing, and historically you are guaranteed, at the absolute worst, a 6.5% annualized return if you wait for 35 years. Plus a well diversified 401k fund, like a Vanguard target retirement fund, may very well include REITs
* The exception here of course is doing something like house hacking, etc. where you are combining your primary residence with an investment. I’m not sophisticated enough yet to run the numbers there, but it seems reasonable on the surface 


&amp;nbsp;


**Some thoughts on the future:**

Forecasting is always risky, but at the same time we all have to form an opinion on where the future is headed. My general thoughts are that crisis tend to accelerate existing trends rather than create new ones. There were already recession concerns in late 2019, and US GDP growth expectations had been downgraded to ~2.0% by the OECD even before COVID (45), albeit with slight optimism around the Phase 1 trade deal with China.  Geopolitical tension and capital controls in China had led to mainland Chinese investors slowing their investments in US real estate and increasing dispositions (47). 

* While there is certainly a housing shortage, even in high growth states we see housing “deficits” according to Fannie Mae of ~5%. While this is clearly substantial, shifting migration patterns, regulatory changes, household preferences (e.g. telecommuting) could easily shift the balance. It’s far from certain in my mind that housing will remain supply constrained in the medium term (i.e. &gt; 3 years) 
* In December 2019, Zillow was already forecasting slowing home price and rental appreciation to modest 2.8% &amp; 2.3% respectively (42) 
* As of March 31 2020, Zillow now forecasts home price appreciation at -1.5% nationally. 
* We are seeing tightening mortgage credit, particularly for jumbo loans that are essentially for high priced real estate markets (44). Mortgage services, i.e. non-bank companies like Quicken, have been hit hard by the mortgage forbearance regulations (although relief measures have been enacted) 
* The CBO is currently forecasting the unemployment rate to remain &gt;10% until 2021 (48). Even if that proves wildly pessimistic, it’s highly probably that the tepid wage gains of the last few years will slow further or even reverse 
* Ultimately with  slowing wage gains and reduced credit in the short term it is hard to see how consumers retain their purchasing power to drive rents / real estate prices substantially higher. 
* On the flip side, central banks globally have injected trillions of dollars of liquidity into the global economy. This has driven down yields in traditional safe havens, e.g. investment grade corporate and sovereign bonds. The question becomes, where does this money go? Does it favor real estate over stocks? Does it lead to inflation, deflation, stagflation? 
* Local &amp; state governments are facing massive budget shortfalls due to dramatically lower revenues (e.g. sales taxes) and higher costs (unemployment insurance, healthcare, etc.). If the federal government does not backstop these revenues, will we see higher state / local taxes or cutbacks in services? 
* As mentioned previously, the tax law changes of 2017 dramatically affected how individuals / households approach their federal taxes. In particular, it is now far less advantageous to itemize property taxes, state taxes, mortgage interest, etc. Mark Zandi (50) of Moody’s analytics provided some interesting analysis that suggested the tax law changes had already impacted higher cost markets. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue, accelerate, or reverse post COVID. 
* The question now becomes how investors, particularly those who entered late in the cycle and lack substantial equity buffers, will deal with conditions. A V shaped recovery would likely see minimal disruption as investors are able to cope with disrupted cash flows for several months. A longer recession would see over-leveraged investors forced to short-sell properties 
* I’m particularly struck by the fact that according to at least one source (27) ~72% of first time home buyers put down 6% or less. These recent buyers lack the equity buffer to deal with any material decline in housing prices, while the modest down payment suggests they may also lack substantial cash reserves to deal with an economic shock. 
* There also seems to me a disconnect between commercial and residential real estate I don’t fully understand. Take a well capitalized and diversified REIT like Brookfield Property Partners. This REIT is currently offering a 14%+ yield. Of course many of their properties like urban office / retail space are getting hammered by COVID. But if we’re assuming that centrally located, urban commercial office &amp; retail spaces are substantially less valuable than pre-COVID, what does that say more broadly about dense urban real estate? After all, if people work from home and don’t go out to commercial real estate spaces, why bother paying a premium in living expenses? 

From my point of view, I’m interested in seeing how the market reacts over the next 3-6 months. Do sellers react by rapidly putting properties on the market before it’s “too late”? Are there enough prime  buyers given the tightening credit, particularly for expensive coastal markets, to absorb a spike in listings? As Warren Buffett once said: “""At rare and unpredictable intervals...credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation--usually win, occasionally die--may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company's upside but does not share in its downside.” We shall see.

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I’m a data scientist by profession but a history major by training. So I’ve tried to cite all relevant data points with a (&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;) tag. This allows us to separate debating the data vs. the analysis. I’m also a complete newbie to real estate investing. One of the main goals in fact of this post is to organize my thoughts so far and solicit feedback from more knowledgable individuals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a balanced portfolio, I&amp;#39;ve invested passively in real estate for several years (both public REITs and a small amount in a private platform). As my assets have grown and I&amp;#39;m entering the age to buy a primary residence, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to educate myself on the housing real estate market. After all, even if you don&amp;#39;t own any investment properties the purchase of a home is the largest single financial transaction you&amp;#39;ll likely ever make. In fact, if you look at the chart linked below (1, see Sources below) you&amp;#39;ll see housing is the single largest asset for households with net worth below 1 million dollars, i.e. ~90% of Americans (2). In fact, even in 2010 (in the midst of the Great Financial Crisis): &amp;quot;The primary residence represented 62% of the median homeowner’s total assets and 42% of the median home owner’s wealth&amp;quot; (3).  In fact, reading the Economist recently (obviously in my slippers) I was surprised to discover housing is the world&amp;#39;s largest asset class. This HSBC report (avoiding the Economist paywall) cites housing as a $226 trillion (!) asset class at the end of 2016 (4) out of a total net worth in 2018 of ~$360 trillion according to Credit Suisse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with my casual research, it&amp;#39;s clear that real estate is divided into multiple segments including residential, commercial, industrial, farm land, etc. Even the subsector of residential is divided into single family, multi-family, commercial, mobile homes, etc. These segments are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. So far I’ve limited my research to the US residential sector: single family homes, multifamily, and small commercial apartment buildings. Therefore moving forward when I say real estate I will limit the scope to the above US residential housing market, i.e. acquiring individual or personal portfolio of US housing properties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More formally, the purpose of my analysis below is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand my options as it pertains to real estate. E.g. is it better to consider “house hacking”, i.e. buying a primary residence and several investment units as part of a duplex, triplex, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid making obvious mistakes in the purchase of my primary home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To summarize what I’ve learned and start to develop opinion about real estate investing more broadly as a complement to public equities investing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broaden my knowledge professionally (my clients include large real estate companies) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn from the community! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I considered posting this in &lt;a href=""/r/realestateinvesting""&gt;/r/realestateinvesting&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately my goal is to evaluate real estate vs. other asset classes. Obviously some people will simply prefer real estate for a variety of reasons, but personally my goal is to achieve the greatest return for the least risk and work. I should stress that I love my career (data scientist) and have no intention of quitting, so the last point is particularly important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that immediately strikes me as an investor accustomed to public securities, e.g. bonds / stocks, is how odd the real estate market (in particular housing) is in comparison. Having a margin account from a broker, i.e. getting leverage, is often a difficult process reserved for “advanced” investors. In residential real estate, it’s considered “conservative” for an individual to have leverage of 4-5 to 1 (FHA loans, for example, only require 3.5% down in some cases!) . What’s even crazier is that the loan is often issued at only 2-4% over the 10 year US treasury rate.  For example today, April 26th, the 10 year treasure is 0.606% while NerdWallet has a rate of 3.3% for a prime credit score, single family home, primary residence 30 year loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because real estate is the only avenue available for newer investors to take on large amounts leverage immediately, I&amp;#39;ve seen extreme and, in my opinion, irrational positions on the subject. Even a cursory glance at BiggerPockets, &lt;a href=""/r/realestateinvesting""&gt;/r/realestateinvesting&lt;/a&gt;, etc. uncovers multiple posts along the lines of either  &amp;quot;real estate investing is the best investment ever!&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;the real estate market is a massive bubble and will crash soon&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve summarized a few of the common tropes I&amp;#39;ve seen below with my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate is a huge bubble, and is going to collapse any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, real estate / housing has numerous segments that are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. Saying that &amp;quot;real estate&amp;quot; will crash is like saying the “food industry” will crash. What segment and where? US soybean growers? Fast Food? Argentinian ranchers?  McDonalds in particular? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting our discussion to US housing: the Case-Shiller national price index (7) shows that home prices dropped ~27% from peak to trough in the Great Financial Crisis over a period of  almost 6 years (Mid 2006 to early 2012). The reason this was such a catastrophic event is that housing had never decreased nationally in a significant way before in the modern era (see Case Schiller home price index). Of course, it’s worth noting that housing had rarely increased rapidly against inflation before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume we had an equivalent event occur. The Jan 2020 index was at 212, so home prices would decrease by 27% to ~155 (mid 2008 levels). Crucially though, this price drop would be expected to play out for years! During that time vested interests (more on that later) would lobby governments extensively for support, foreign and US investors could form funds to take advantage of the situation, etc. As a reference point there is ~$1.5 trillion available in US private equity funds alone as of January 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is worth pointing out that this is at the national level. Local real estate markets, particularly those dependent on select industries or foreign investors, could easily see more dramatic price movements. The US census has a really cool chart (22) that shows the inflation adjusted (as of year 2000) median home values every decade by state from 1940 to 2000. We see that Minnesota home values actually dropped from $105,000 in 1980 to $94,500 in 1990, a fall of more than 10%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a place to live, therefore housing can never go down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a place to eat, but restaurants and grocery stores are famously low margin businesses (5). Farms supply an even more basic need, but many go bankrupt (6). The question isn’t whether housing will go down or not, but whether it will return an attractive rate of return compared to alternative investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth pointing out that for most “retail” US housing real estate investors, they are investing in a narrow geographic area. Migration and births/ deaths can play a huge role in the need for housing in a given area. Case in point, NYC may have actually begun losing population to migration in 2017 / 2018 (23). Even more interesting, NYC has experienced a substantial loss due to domestic migration which is almost balanced by foreign immigration / new births (24). If foreign immigration decreases in the post-COVID we would expect NYC’s population to decline more rapidly given current trends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is entirely possible for national housing prices to modestly increase while expensive coastal markets decline significantly, for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s supply and demand. There&amp;#39;s a nationwide housing shortage so prices can only go up! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one has some factual basis. Freddie Mac put out a study in Feb 2020 (18) which indicated that there is a shortage of housing units between 2.5 - 3.3 million units. Some interesting notes about this study is that they consider the “missing” household formation and extrapolate interstate migration trends. As noted below, the US builds ~1.3 million housing units a year, so this reflects ~2 years of housing construction. It’s also worth noting the geographic variation, with “high growth” states like Massachusetts, California, Colorado, etc. seeing ~5% housing deficits vs. states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc. seeing housing surpluses of ~2-4%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a Zillow analysis on our aging population (11) points to a slightly different conclusion. Based on their analysis, an additional ~190,000 home will be released by seniors between 2017-2027 compared to 2007-2017. That number increases by another 250,000 homes annually between 2027-2037. Combined, this is about ~50% of the average annual homes constructed in the US between 2000-2009 at ~900,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these slightly conflicting reports, let’s get back to basics. First, let&amp;#39;s separate housing into single family homes, multi-family units, and large apartment buildings. Single family homes, particularly near dense and economically vibrant metros, are far more supply constrained. In contrast, multi family units / apartment towers are, barring regulatory issues (see California), less constrained by available land. See Hudson Yards in NYC, the Seaport area in Boston, the Wharf in DC, etc. It&amp;#39;s worth noting that due to costs / market demand most of these developments cater to the entry level luxury category and above, but they are new supply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually wound up looking at US Census projections to get a sense of the long term outlook. By 2030 the Census estimates the population will grow from 334.5 million to 359.4, for a total increase of 24.9 million or an annual increase of 2.49 million (8). In 2019 the Census estimated 888,000 private single family units and 403,000 units in buildings w/ 2+ units were constructed for a grand total of 1,291,000 units (9). The average number of people per US household is 2.52 (10). Some simple math suggests that if we assume each new single family home contains the average number of Americans and each apartment conservatively contains only a single person we get 888,000 * 2.52 + 403,000 = ~2.64 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, talking about averages in a national real estate market reminds me of a joke about Mars: on average it&amp;#39;s a balmy 72 degrees. But the point still stands that at a high level, theoretical sense there is sufficient  &amp;quot;housing&amp;quot; for the US population. The question, as always, is at what price and location? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate is a safer investment than the stock market!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one honestly irritates me. While there are many advantages to real estate I can see, safety is not one of them. It is a highly leveraged, illiquid, extremely concentrated asset when bought individually (i.e not in a REIT). Let’s use an example here. Is there a financial advisoy in the world who would recommend you put your entire investment portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway? Of course not, diversification is the bedrock of modern personal finance. And yet Berkshire Hathaway is an extremely diversified asset manager with well run and capitalized companies ranging from Geico to Berkshire Homes to Berkshire Energy. Oh, and it also has $130 billion (with a B) in cash equivalents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly think this impression stems from 3 factors: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all asset prices have gone up (barring a few 1-2 month downturns) for 10+ years. There was also a shortage of skilled labor, capital, etc. that dramatically reduced the new supply of housing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivorship bias. The people who fail in real estate tend to limp away quietly. The ones who survive and succeed tout their success loudly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t build your wealth in the stock market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common theme I’m already noticing listening to podcasts, reading blogs, etc. is that many people started investing in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis (2009 - 2011). And, in retrospect, it was clearly a great time to buy property! But it was also a great time it turns out to buy almost every investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plugged in the average annual return of the S&amp;amp;P 500 from December 2009 to December 2019 with dividends reinvested (and ignoring the 15-20% long term tax on dividends) (12). It was 13.3%. If you managed to buy at the market bottom of Feb 2009 it was 15.8%! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term annual average of the S&amp;amp;P 500 from 1926 - 2018 is ~10-11% (with dividends reinvested). (13). The S&amp;amp;P has never lost money in a 30 year period with dividends reinvested, see the fantastic book Stocks for the Long Run (14). In fact, if you’re investing before 30 the worst 35 year period (i.e. when you would turn 65) is 6.1% (15). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing, in general, has tracked at or slightly above inflation ( 16). Even a click bait CNBC article (17) about “skyrocketing” home prices states that homes are rising 2x as fast as inflation (i.e. ~4%). If you look at the CNBC chart for inflation adjusted prices, you’ll see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% from 1940 to 2000. Let’s do this same exercise again with the Average Sales Price of Homes from Fred (i.e. Fed economic data) (18). In Q1 1963 the average sales price of a house was $19,300. In Q4 2019 it was $382,300. That is a CAGR of ~5.38% over ~57 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that while real estate does have some tax advantages, there are also property taxes, maintenance, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s harder than that. Because real estate is an illiquid asset. In general, illiquid assets require higher returns than 
the equivalent liquid asset because of the inconvenience / risk of not having the ability to transact frequently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case study of real estate purchase:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to focus the rest of my analysis on an area that many members of BiggerPockets, &lt;a href=""/r/realestateinvesting""&gt;/r/realestateinvesting&lt;/a&gt;, etc. seem to gloss over: credit. I was surprised to see that for first time home buyers, 72% made a down payment of 6% or less according in Dec 2018 according to (27). This would imply prices only have to decrease 6% to put these new homebuyers underwater, i.e. owe more after a sale than their mortgage. But  this fails to take into account costs associated with buying a property, which are substantial at 2-5% for closing according to Zillow (28). Costs for selling a property are even more substantial, ranging from 8-10% according to Zillow (29). This means that sellers only putting down 6% could be underwater (in the sense that they couldn’t sell without providing cash during the sale) with even modest price decreases when taking into account these transactional costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are ways to reduce these costs, so let’s walk through a hypothetical example of the median valued home of ~$200,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young, first time home-buyer puts down 10%, or $20k, and takes out a mortgage for $180,000. They also pay (optimistically) closing costs of 2% for $4000. Luckily, they bought in a hot housing market and prices increased 5% (real) over the next 5 years. Their house is now worth ~$255,000. They sell their house and again, optimistically, closing costs are only 4%. This means they pay $10,200. Consequently, after netting out costs we calculate naively that they would make $255k - $10k - $4k - $200k (original purchase price of home) = $41k. Given they only invested $20k of their own money, this is a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~15.4%, which is handily above the S&amp;amp;P 500’s average. This is the naive calculation I first made, but as we’ll see it is deeply flawed. First, let’s look at costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WalletHub has a really nice chart that shows (conveniently) property taxes on a $205,000 home across all 50 states (30). The average American household spends $2375 on property taxes, so let’s assume a little less and go for $1500. So 5 years x $1500 = $7500. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For home maintenance, the consensus seems to be ~1% annually for home maintenance with wide variation. We’ll assume that’s $2000 off the base price, so $2000 * 5 = $10,000.  (31).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For homeowner’s insurance, Bankrate (32) provides a nice graph that shows the average annual cost for a $300,000 dwelling across all states and then a separate chart for costs based on dwelling coverage. For a $200,000 dwelling coverage we have a figure of $1806 per year, so over 5 years we have $1800 * 5 = $9000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we need to calculate the interest on the debt. One thing that I didn’t realize until I looked at an amortization table how front-loaded the interest payments are. Case in point, I plugged in the $180,000 loan into the amortization calculator (34) using a 3.5% interest rate and saw that we pay on average ~$6000 each year in interest vs. only ~$3800 to principal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So lets’s run the new numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sell your home still for $255,000. After 5 years, your mortgage is now ~$160000 (i.e. you paid off 20,000 over 5 years, or ~$4k per year). So after the sale  you are left with ~$95,000. The buying and selling costs remain the same as before, so we subtract the $14k for $81,000. We also then subtract $7500 (property taxes), $10,000 (home maintenance), $9000 (homeowners insurance)  which gives us $54,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paid ~$9,700 each year in mortgage interest + principle (~6000 interest and $3700 principal). So  5 * 9700 = $48,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, net of everything we get $255,000 - $160,000 (remaining mortgage) - $48,500 (mortgage payments over 5 years) - $14k (buying / selling costs) - $7500 (property taxes) - $10,000 (home maintenance) - $9000 (home insurance) =  $6000. And we put down $20,000 as a downpayment, for a net compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of negative $21.4%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is truly an astounding result. We had 10x leverage on an asset that went up 5% each year for 5 years and we somehow lost money on our “investment” of a down payment? Keep in mind we also used fairly optimistic numbers (particularly home price appreciation) and didn’t factor in PMI, etc. On the flip side, this home provided shelter, i.e. you didn’t pay rent. That’s a massive “avoided” cost and I don’t mean to minimize it. But the point here is that many homebuyers I’ve spoken to fail to account for the substantial costs of home ownership and expect their primary resident to generate a substantial return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, for real estate investing you would likely either a) hold the property for less time and attempt to flip it via forced appreciation or b) have tenants in the property. Let’s focus on b) because frankly that’s more of my interest. From what little research I’ve done flipping houses requires much more  time that’s incompatible with my day job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went ahead and used the rental price calculator I found online at (36) to calculate the return. I used a rent of $1300 monthly, a bit lower than the average national rent of $1476 (35) because our home price was also lower than the national average. I assumed a low vacancy rate of 5%, and no other expenses beyond the ones cited above (i.e. I didn’t assume property management, higher loan interest rate, higher property taxes). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calculator spit back a 5 year internal rate of return (a metric in this case useful  to compare against the securities markets)  of 27.79% return, i.e. a profit of $63k on an initial investment of $20k. The IRR as I understand it captures the time value of money, basically accounting for when you made various returns (37). E.g if an investment over 30 years pays nothing then gives you a lump sum payment at the end that’s very different than if it pays 1/30th of that lump sum every year. It’s useful in this case for comparing against the stock market because the IRR takes all future cash flows  back to a net present value of 0, i.e. as if we invested all the money immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp;Now let’s do some scenario modeling (originally we had 10% down, 3.5% interest rate for an IRR of ~28%):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s assume we have to put down 20%:  now we have a 19% IRR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% down payment and a 5.5% (instead of 3.5%) interest rate: 14.7% IRR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home price appreciation of only 3% per year instead of 5% with 10% down payment: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home price appreciation of only 3% per year with 20% down payment: 12.65%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 10% down payment: 4.26%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 20% down payment: -1.28%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario for me demonstrated a number of interesting properties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning a home for even a moderate amount of time (~5 years) will likely not build substantial wealth unless there is truly massive home appreciation. The transactional costs are too high, the ongoing costs are substantial, etc. And of course I’ve neglected to include all the remodeling, furniture, etc. that every home owner I’ve met has spent money on &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With regards to real estate investing, home price appreciation covers up a magnitude of sins, particularly if coupled with a low cost of debt. Changing nothing but the home price appreciation changes the investment from incredible (28% IRR) to about 1/2 the expected return of the S&amp;amp;P 500 (4.26%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate, whether investing or owning a primary residence, has limited to negative cash flow initially. The loan is amortized so that all early payments go to interest, maintenance is expensive, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To sanity check these figures, I went and looked at the SEC filings of Invitation Homes which owns 80,000 single family homes in the US. In 2019, Invitation Homes made ~$1.764 billion on rent + other property income while spending a combine ~$730 million on property maintenance + management.(49) . That’s about ~41% of the total property income, which aligns with the rental calculator above (rent payments fo 1300 vs ~$570 for maintenance, taxes, insurance, vacancy, etc.). That honestly makes me nervous however, as Invitation Homes theoretically has the scale to centralize and minimize maintenance costs. While I could certainly substitute “sweat equity” for some repairs, it strikes me that it would be foolish to assume my costs would be lower than Invitation Homes’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;401k analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, one of the big questions around real estate investing that I rarely see asked is “is it an appreciably better investment than the alternatives”? For W2 workers, which is ~50% of private sector workers, this question becomes even more pertinent because 401ks have massive tax benefits. In fact, only 33% of US households own taxable accounts outside of a 401k, which means the vast bulk of US households either have no accounts, 38%, or own only a retirement account like a 401k, 29%, according to (39). Let’s assume we have a middle to upper middle class worker making ~70k (this puts them roughly at the 75% percentile). They want to invest, and see two options: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest $20,000 post-tax in a downpayment  on a $200,000 investment property just like in the above analysis (we’ll assume closing costs just get baked into the final net gain) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest the equivalent amount of post-tax dollars into their 401k. You can probably see where I’m going with this by the use of “post-tax”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a salary of $70k and assuming you took the $12k standard deduction, you would still see much of your income fall into the 22% tax bracket. While certain states charge no income tax, they generally make it up in much higher sales / property taxes, so let’s also assume a 3% state income tax (40). This means that if you invest $19,500 in a 401k (the maximum in 2020) that’s equivalent to only $14,625 post-tax (because the $19,500 would be taxed ~25% before it got to you). That leaves almost $6000 when compared with the down payment figure above, which is coincidentally the exact IRA contribution limit for 2020! The math for deductions for the IRA gets painful, but we can assume a deduction of ~$1500 (i.e. 25% of 6000). Now, if your work offers an HSA it gets even better, because those contributions are tax-free even from social security (which is typically a 6.2% tax) + medicaid (1.45%). This means that if you contribute the $3500 limit, that’s equivalent to only $2300 post-tax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is getting rather long, so for the sake of simplicity we can basically say that in lieu of putting down a $20,000 post-tax downpayment on an investment property you could instead invest $19500 + $6000 + $3500 = $29000 into the stock market. What’s more, fees for well managed 401ks through Vanguard, Schwab are often ~0.25% (i.e. $72 annually on the $29k above). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we assume the average S&amp;amp;P 500 index returns of 10% (we’ll ignore the $72 annually in expenses and of course there are no taxes), we would see $29k compounded over 5 years = $47,809. Since we’re investing the money all immediately, this is (I believe) more or less equivalent to the IRR rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to achieve to beat that return with our investment property? Well, we previously assumed a blistering 5% real home price appreciation. With inflation at ~2%, that’s a nominal 7% home price appreciation. According to both Zillow and Core logic, Idaho is the state with the fastest home appreciation values pre-COVID at ~9%. We’re essentially predicting close to this level for 5 years, which is quite rare. In August 2019, US home prices nationally were gaining ~2.6% according to (41).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s plug those numbers into our rental property calculator from above. At a 10% down payment, 3.5% interest rate, and 2.6% home price appreciation we see an IRR of 18% per year. Game, set, match, real estate, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, sort of. Right now we are assuming optimistic projections about maintenance (1%), closing costs (2%), and selling costs (4%). What if we bump those up to the averages cited by Zillow (3% and 8%)? Uh-oh, now we’re down to 12.38%. Okay, but what if we assume rent goes up by the same amount, ~2%? Great! Now we’re back up to 14% IRR. But if we assume all the other expenses like home insurance and maintenance go up 2% a year as well, we’re back down to 11%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could go on forever, but the point is that real estate (particularly for rental properties) are extremely sensitive to assumptions you make on a number of factors. Given the risk, illiquidity, and work involved with a real estate property I would want to see a substantially higher return than the tax advantaged, hands off 10% my 401k gives me. I didn’t even include the typical 3% match for the 401k, which would have added $2100 to the initial investment amount and increased the 5 year return to $51,272.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line in my mind is that for most W2 workers who have access to pre-tax investments, they should max them out first. If you’re lucky enough to be able to max out all of the above pre-tax accounts + get a 3% match (i.e. $31k total) every year, after 15 years at a 10% return you’ll have $1.2 million. In 30 years you’ll have $6.8 million. And again, keep in mind that maxing out your pre-tax accounts only “costs” you ~$20k, because that’s what you would get after taxes. And you’ll have “made” those millions without spending a single hour outside of your day job working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on the above analysis and calculations, here’s what I’ve come away with as a newbie to real estate investing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate investing involves significant risk. Achieving high returns relies upon either significant home appreciation or accurately calculating several key inputs (rental rates, maintenance costs, etc.). The past decades strong home appreciation has likely saved some investors from faulty assumptions, simply because their highly leveraged investment increased in value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the significant transaction, maintenance, tax, and other costs simply buying and living in a single family home is not guaranteed to build substantial wealth in the short term (i.e. &amp;lt; 10 years) even with significant price appreciation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story of real estate investing is really the story of credit availability. Low interest rates, widespread credit, etc. allow investors to take on significant leverage and potentially achieve high returns. On the flip side, if credit tightens we could see substantial movements in real estate as valuations adjust to the more expensive or less available leverage &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally, I would want to see at least 12+% returns annually before I invested in real estate directly vs. a diversified stock portfolio. Potentially having a cash flow negative, illiquid, highly leveraged asset is a risk that I want to be compensated for by a higher return. Obviously there are many advantages to real estate I’ve not yet learned in depth about (e.g. taxes), so perhaps this premium will change slightly in my mind in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re a younger, W2 wage earning in the US with the access and ability to contribute to a 401k, IRA, and HSA you should do that first before even considering real estate investing. The tax advantages are immense, the time investment is essentially nothing, and historically you are guaranteed, at the absolute worst, a 6.5% annualized return if you wait for 35 years. Plus a well diversified 401k fund, like a Vanguard target retirement fund, may very well include REITs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exception here of course is doing something like house hacking, etc. where you are combining your primary residence with an investment. I’m not sophisticated enough yet to run the numbers there, but it seems reasonable on the surface &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some thoughts on the future:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasting is always risky, but at the same time we all have to form an opinion on where the future is headed. My general thoughts are that crisis tend to accelerate existing trends rather than create new ones. There were already recession concerns in late 2019, and US GDP growth expectations had been downgraded to ~2.0% by the OECD even before COVID (45), albeit with slight optimism around the Phase 1 trade deal with China.  Geopolitical tension and capital controls in China had led to mainland Chinese investors slowing their investments in US real estate and increasing dispositions (47). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While there is certainly a housing shortage, even in high growth states we see housing “deficits” according to Fannie Mae of ~5%. While this is clearly substantial, shifting migration patterns, regulatory changes, household preferences (e.g. telecommuting) could easily shift the balance. It’s far from certain in my mind that housing will remain supply constrained in the medium term (i.e. &amp;gt; 3 years) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In December 2019, Zillow was already forecasting slowing home price and rental appreciation to modest 2.8% &amp;amp; 2.3% respectively (42) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of March 31 2020, Zillow now forecasts home price appreciation at -1.5% nationally. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are seeing tightening mortgage credit, particularly for jumbo loans that are essentially for high priced real estate markets (44). Mortgage services, i.e. non-bank companies like Quicken, have been hit hard by the mortgage forbearance regulations (although relief measures have been enacted) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBO is currently forecasting the unemployment rate to remain &amp;gt;10% until 2021 (48). Even if that proves wildly pessimistic, it’s highly probably that the tepid wage gains of the last few years will slow further or even reverse &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately with  slowing wage gains and reduced credit in the short term it is hard to see how consumers retain their purchasing power to drive rents / real estate prices substantially higher. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the flip side, central banks globally have injected trillions of dollars of liquidity into the global economy. This has driven down yields in traditional safe havens, e.g. investment grade corporate and sovereign bonds. The question becomes, where does this money go? Does it favor real estate over stocks? Does it lead to inflation, deflation, stagflation? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local &amp;amp; state governments are facing massive budget shortfalls due to dramatically lower revenues (e.g. sales taxes) and higher costs (unemployment insurance, healthcare, etc.). If the federal government does not backstop these revenues, will we see higher state / local taxes or cutbacks in services? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned previously, the tax law changes of 2017 dramatically affected how individuals / households approach their federal taxes. In particular, it is now far less advantageous to itemize property taxes, state taxes, mortgage interest, etc. Mark Zandi (50) of Moody’s analytics provided some interesting analysis that suggested the tax law changes had already impacted higher cost markets. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue, accelerate, or reverse post COVID. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The question now becomes how investors, particularly those who entered late in the cycle and lack substantial equity buffers, will deal with conditions. A V shaped recovery would likely see minimal disruption as investors are able to cope with disrupted cash flows for several months. A longer recession would see over-leveraged investors forced to short-sell properties &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m particularly struck by the fact that according to at least one source (27) ~72% of first time home buyers put down 6% or less. These recent buyers lack the equity buffer to deal with any material decline in housing prices, while the modest down payment suggests they may also lack substantial cash reserves to deal with an economic shock. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There also seems to me a disconnect between commercial and residential real estate I don’t fully understand. Take a well capitalized and diversified REIT like Brookfield Property Partners. This REIT is currently offering a 14%+ yield. Of course many of their properties like urban office / retail space are getting hammered by COVID. But if we’re assuming that centrally located, urban commercial office &amp;amp; retail spaces are substantially less valuable than pre-COVID, what does that say more broadly about dense urban real estate? After all, if people work from home and don’t go out to commercial real estate spaces, why bother paying a premium in living expenses? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, I’m interested in seeing how the market reacts over the next 3-6 months. Do sellers react by rapidly putting properties on the market before it’s “too late”? Are there enough prime  buyers given the tightening credit, particularly for expensive coastal markets, to absorb a spike in listings? As Warren Buffett once said: “&amp;quot;At rare and unpredictable intervals...credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation--usually win, occasionally die--may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company&amp;#39;s upside but does not share in its downside.” We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I posted in WSB, but the DD is more in the style of r/investing. Estimates used actual fleet composition of each company, using spot rates of each vessel class starting from beginning of Q2. 


For you all that think it’s too late to get in the tankers, some of these companies are going to put up earnings numbers in Q2 that are 1/4-1/2 of their market cap.

EURN will put up about 3.50eps- stock is 12.20

TNK 7.50eps -25

TNP 2.00 -4 (that’s 50%)

NAT 1- stock price anywhere from 4-20, at this point who knows

DHT- 2.50 -8.30 (going to have a disappointing q1 because they got unlucky in the beginning of q1, as they said in their q4 conference call)

FRO 2.50- stock 10.50

And half the quarter is basically locked in because the ships are chartering for the first week of May at high rates. The day rates would have to crash to alter these projections. Even if rates went to 0 TNP still makes 1/4 of its market cap q2.

The product tanker guys, like stng and asc are even higher going forward, because their rates just jumped this past week. Just today, an LR2 (2 sizes smaller than a VLCC) now charters for more a day than a VLCC. Now this wasn’t all quarter, but if it kept up, those rates would earn stng and asc (who own only MRs) closer to 80%-90% of their stock price every 90 days. 

Lastly, every conference call these companies do, they let the analyst know what their average fleet TCE (day rate) is for the quarter to date.  If you look at the analyst projections right now, they have not been updated yet. You are going to a get line of upgrades as the q1 conference calls end because of the monster numbers that the tankers have already put up in q2. 

To show you how out of date the projections are, EURN has a q2 projection of 1.20.... they earned that in April.",t2_4f9fkci,False,,0,False,Q2 Tanker earnings estimates.,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_g9k5mr,False,dark,0.92,,public,63,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,63,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588095041.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted in WSB, but the DD is more in the style of &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;r/investing&lt;/a&gt;. Estimates used actual fleet composition of each company, using spot rates of each vessel class starting from beginning of Q2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For you all that think it’s too late to get in the tankers, some of these companies are going to put up earnings numbers in Q2 that are 1/4-1/2 of their market cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EURN will put up about 3.50eps- stock is 12.20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TNK 7.50eps -25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TNP 2.00 -4 (that’s 50%)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAT 1- stock price anywhere from 4-20, at this point who knows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHT- 2.50 -8.30 (going to have a disappointing q1 because they got unlucky in the beginning of q1, as they said in their q4 conference call)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRO 2.50- stock 10.50&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And half the quarter is basically locked in because the ships are chartering for the first week of May at high rates. The day rates would have to crash to alter these projections. Even if rates went to 0 TNP still makes 1/4 of its market cap q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product tanker guys, like stng and asc are even higher going forward, because their rates just jumped this past week. Just today, an LR2 (2 sizes smaller than a VLCC) now charters for more a day than a VLCC. Now this wasn’t all quarter, but if it kept up, those rates would earn stng and asc (who own only MRs) closer to 80%-90% of their stock price every 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, every conference call these companies do, they let the analyst know what their average fleet TCE (day rate) is for the quarter to date.  If you look at the analyst projections right now, they have not been updated yet. You are going to a get line of upgrades as the q1 conference calls end because of the monster numbers that the tankers have already put up in q2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show you how out of date the projections are, EURN has a q2 projection of 1.20.... they earned that in April.&lt;/p&gt;

I've mostly been investing in ETFs and some stocks to play around, but over the years have gotten more interested in building a long-term buy &amp; hold stock portfolio myself. I currently have some time to spare and interest in analyzing companies and doing some legwork. 

There are plenty of posts here that discuss whether individual stock picking can beat the market or not  - this is not one of them.

I'm mainly looking for legit services that don't spam you with upselling their services (think MF) that could help along the way in screening and researching stocks. Resources I'm currently using are FT, WSJ, and Handelsblatt (suscription); and barrons, yahoo finance, Morningstar, google finance and vhinny (free).

One that I'd be particularly interested in is '**New Constructs**', which is a mix of human and AI robo advisor service created by MIT and HBS professors and researchers. Their proposition is to be ""the only Investment Research provider with a U.S. Patent for a system and method to reverse accounting distortion and analyze financial information to automatically determine the true profitability of a company, making us one of the top investment research firms in the nation."" Their research gets featured regularly in finance news across the board including Barrons, Reuters, Forbes, NYT, cnbc, etc. Their two premium services are priced at $50 and $100 per month.

,investing,"So i was [reading this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2004/01/2004a_bpea_geanakoplos.pdf) thought it was interesting. They take they comapre younger working adults to middle age (age 40-65) working adults to try to predict the stock market. The basic theory is that younger adults(age 20-39) are likely to take out debt and be broke from having kids vs middle age whom would be investing and building their retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i was interested in a different ratio: the **retired population vs the working population**, defined as:

\-working population age 19-64

\-retired popuation 65+

My general thesis is that the working population serves as buyers into the stock market and the retired population serves as eventually sellers in the stock market. And yes, im aware many retiress stay invested, but they stop adding to their accounts and begin to make withdrawals overall. **I'll post the data in the comment section** to make this post easier to read.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1950 the ratio is about 10x, meaning there are 10 working class buying stocks for every 1 retiree withdrawaling from stocks. Today that ratio has steadily decreased and to about  6x and will be  3.5x by the time many of you retire.

Food for thought: how many new buyers does it take to replace one seller? Adjusted for inflation, the dow jones has made 1,000% gains since the 1950s, so does it take 10x new buyers to displace a seller with 1,000% return? luckily they are not cashing out 100% and only take out what they need to spend each month.

,investing,"50/50 rebalancing quarterly.

I used to buy these two ETFs all throughout 2010-2018.  I also owned stocks and I never held these two ETFs for too long because lots of older people with more financial industry experience than me said it wouldn't work.

Now it's 2020 and I've gotta ask... If we look at a portfolio of TMF/TQQQ bought 50/50 on January 1st is up 28%.

That is better than any stock index.

If we do a back test for multiple years I get higher Sharpe ratios, higher CAGR, the best year performance is significantly more exaggerated than the worst year performance, etc.

You are forced to buy low and sell high... And it's clearly beating the SPY.

If anything it might make sense to add a small position in an actual treasury fund like TLT or IEF to offset some of the leverage... But the back testing says something else.

I used portfolio visualizer and SPY as my benchmark.

Anyone have any legitimate reasons why this is not a good idea?

Edit:

I've added some data.  We are starting in 2010 with $10000 invested equally into TQQQ and TMF.  Then $1000 is added quarterly.  Portfolio is rebalanced quarterly as well.

SPY:
final balance $84,114
CAGR 25.89%
best year 32%
worst year -19%
Sharpe .79

50/50 TMF/TQQQ:
final balance $386,000
CAGR 48.46%
best year 86.59%
worst year -7.36%
Sharpe 1.41


TLDR

considering how the fed has been acting, the precedent is bailouts and socialization of losses.  What real world scenario am I missing where TMF/TQQQ does not continue to outperform a more traditional stock/bond portfolio?

Considering the portfolio is up 28% YTD can we assume it has been debunked that leveraged ETFs can't be held long term.

,investing,"I know there has been speculation as to if the US treasury yields will go negative, but there is something I've been contemplating: the effective yield of them already has \*been\* negative for some time.

There were many times even in the last decade where the 10 year T-bond yield was below the stated inflation goal rate, and now it's around 0.6%, implying a return of -1.4%.

What I am wondering is, why are people investing in these securities which are going to lose money after inflation happens? Is it simply because of an oversupply of dollars? Or is it an undersupply problem?

Less dollars in the system means the yields will fall lower, and inflation will pull even more out.

In the last recession in 2008, inflation hit around 5.5%, with the 10 year bond yield sitting around 3.5%. If inflation hits between 5%-6% again, the spread between that and the yield is going to be much larger.

So i came to here to see if i'm doing this right and had a few questions

1. Will i need to sell my stock when it comes to the 19th of may which is when Oil-19May20 runs out?
2. is it worth just selling now and investing into oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron or go to something like the United States oil fund

I'm pretty happy with my normal brokerage (Schwab) but am young and am interested in opportunities to take more risk. I opened an IBKR account and my plan is to invest a modest sum (maybe 5k) in some index funds using margin.

* Lincoln Electric **(LECO)** - Essential Business - Q1 EPS decreases 18.8% to $0.91. Shared **up 5%**.
* Washington Trust **(WASH)** - Earnings per share were down 32.00% year over year to $0.68, which missed the estimate of $0.80. Shares **up 5%**.
* NIC (**EGOV**) - Earnings per share were down 14.29% year over year to $0.18, which were in line with the estimate of $0.18. ***10% down*** on opening.
* CNX Resources (**CNX**) - Q1 EPS of -$1.76, consensus of $0.11. Revenue of $416.36M (+49.5% Y/Y). **15% up** in first hour of open.
* CMS Energy (**CMS**) - Earnings per share were up 14.67% year over year to $0.86, which beat the estimate of $0.79. ***Down 1.5%*** upon hour of opening.

&gt; In Russia, one of the world’s top producers, the industry is considering resorting to burning its oil to take it off the market, sources told Reuters. 

&gt; U.S. billionaire Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources Inc sent servicers out into fields in Oklahoma and North Dakota in the middle of the week to abruptly shut wells, and the company declared it could not make crude deliveries to customers due to poor economics.

&gt; Continental’s decision to declare force majeure - usually reserved for wars, accidents or natural disasters - came as a shock, bringing a sharp response from the leading refinery industry group. But some say there is a logic behind it, even if it may not pass muster in court.

&gt; “You sign contracts based on the average norms that a society has experienced over the last 100 years. If we have a new event that is not covered by those norms, it goes into force majeure. That’s what Harold Hamm and others are saying - that these are circumstances outside the norm,” said Anas Alhajji, an energy market expert based in Dallas. 

&gt; Azerbaijan, part of the group of nations known as OPEC+, is forcing a BP-led group to cut output for the first time ever. Oil majors in those countries have generally been excluded from government-imposed cuts.

&gt; “We have never done it before since they came to the country in 1994 and signed the contract of the century,” a senior Azeri official told Reuters. 

&gt; That accommodation can no longer be made with the world running out of space to put oil. As of Thursday, energy researcher Kpler said onshore storage worldwide is now roughly 85% full. 

&gt; “I’m sure hearing the same numbers about demand destruction of 20 to 30 million barrels a day,” said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy, who was working at the New York Mercantile Exchange when U.S. crude futures were launched in 1983. “Until we see some kind of alleviation of that, you have to wonder what is in store.”",t2_tnbcy,False,,0,False,"Reuters: Russia is considering resorting to burning its oil to take it off the market, Continental Resources Inc abruptly shutting wells in Oklahoma and North Dakota",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_g8kwpa,False,dark,0.97,,public,801,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,801,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1587958801.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-turmoil/when-oil-became-waste-a-week-of-turmoil-for-crude-and-more-pain-to-come-idUSKCN228059""&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-turmoil/when-oil-became-waste-a-week-of-turmoil-for-crude-and-more-pain-to-come-idUSKCN228059&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"After a long time of very responsibly trading blue chip stocks for modest gains single digit gains, last week I started contriving a plan to get into oil and ""hit it big"".

I spent at least 40 hours considering all my possible options. Then on Monday afternoon, it became clear to me - **it was time to strike**. I put 50% of my money in.

Tuesday morning was not fun.

Here's what I learned:

* **Don’t ever buy something you don’t FULLY understand.** On Monday, I bought into USO as oil prices bottomed, thinking I was buying into a fund that was purchasing up all of the May Futures contracts. I thought USO was rolling out of April and into May, and they were conveniently buying up all the world’s WTI at bottom of the barrel pricing. I saw the warnings all over the place that people didn’t understand that USO was based on futures, not spot prices. I KNEW USO was buying futures, not spot. I thought that meant I understood the warnings. I didn’t know that the real risk was that I didn’t know which months I was buying into. The funny truth is that they weren’t even making most of their moves on Monday. I was WAY off.
* **Don’t trust third party sources on the details - not even your bank.** Both Yahoo Finance, and my bank - RBC Direct Investing - have incorrect information on USO and most major ETFs. For as long as I have been looking (2 weeks), they've said USO is holding April WTI Futures. This is 100% false: [https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png) I thought this meant that USO had to sell all those contracts and move into May contracts on Monday. I thought USO was being paid to take a bunch of oil that they would then have all month to get rid of. But that's not how this works.
* **The word “ETF” is used extremely loosely.** An ETF like SPY or ZQQ.to, is absolutely nothing like all the ETFs out there that are “attempting to track daily movements of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_”. An ""ETF"" is just a fund. Don’t buy into ETFs that you do not FULLY understand. Read the actual prospectus.
* **Do not underestimate the number of stupid investors out there.** As I watched WTI plummet in real time, I immediately saw USO skyrocketing, I thought for sure that meant that smart institutional money was piling into USO. I thought there was no way that retail investors could move a $2.5B fund that fast, but they were. That was not smart money causing the pump. It was a million idiots like me.
* **Don’t fuck around with leveraged ETFs.** In addition to USO, I purchased into a 2X leveraged WTI tracking ETF “HOU.to” at the very end of the day on Monday. I thought for sure on Tuesday morning the oil prices would bounce back up from negative, and give me a big bump. I figured, even if it didn’t work out, I could hold onto it forever until oil comes back. Wrong. You cannot hold onto these things forever. They trend towards 0 mathematically. If you can’t make gains in your first couple of days or weeks, you are probably stuck with taking a loss. You shouldn’t even hold these things more than a single trading day. ESPECIALLY in this crazy market.
* **Despite your Father's advice, you can't just be patient and hold on to everything.** [HOU.to](https://HOU.to) \- which I purchased into - is beyond toast. The company has all but told investors it’s time to cash out. After the fund lost 40% of it’s value on Tuesday, they froze it, and then released an official press release that the ETF was worth about 1/6th of its already obliterated market price. They then said pretty clearly that they no longer expected to be able to achieve the funds objectives. After a few cuss words, I basically kissed my money goodbye. Then much to my pleasant surprise, on Wednesday morning, I saw it was back up for trade. Somehow it was rising. (This goes back to not underestimating the power of stupid money.) I cashed out immediately, and was very pleased to get 2 /3 of my money back. Everyone around me was telling me to be patient and not take a loss. The fund has done nothing but post double digit losses since then, yet millions of people are continuing to trade it, when they should instead be cutting their losses. While June futures are up 70% since Tuesday, this 2x ETF is down like 50% - yet people still cling on.
* **The biggest lesson in these oil ETF’s is that NOTHING is certain in this crazy ass market.** A TON of the pain that I felt this week was caused by USO and other funds like them restructuring. USO has been rolling front month futures on a predictable calendar for 12 years. On Tuesday morning they absolutely fucked my investment in USO, and probably contributed to the obliteration of HOU.to by surprising us all with a restructuring announcement. I never in my life thought that USO was going to restructure. I thought the whole point of it was that they were legally obligated to follow a certain predictable futures trading pattern - and that certainty gave people a mechanism to buy and sell. NOPE. They can legally just do whatever the hell they want, costing retail investors like me an arm and a leg, while their fund managers continue to make 7 figure salaries.
* **Last but certainly not least, this week should be a lesson to us all that there are mammoth sized financial incongruities hidden in every corner of the global economy right now.** The insanity that has taken place in the oil industry this week should be a warning bell to us all. The 2008 crisis was caused by bad assets in a SINGLE industry. Considering the demand for everything is down by at least 30%, and the governments have propped the world up with free cash equivalent to over 10% of global GDP - it’s quite certain that there are “sub prime mortgage backed security” equivalent death traps forming in every single industry. It’s only a matter of time before more of them pop up. They could appear on Monday. They could appear in August. But anyone who is paying attention is fairly certain they are out there.

,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,0,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,269,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,269,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

This weakness seems pretty troubling considering Tesla's commitments to pay $323 million starting in 2023 to maintain their Shanghai factory lease. Meanwhile, Tesla had to drop prices to get below subsidy thresholds and China plans to drop the ceiling another 20% next year.

,investing,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/11/coronavirus-fda-grants-emergency-use-authorization-abbott-labs-antibody-test.html

&gt;The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories’ new coronavirus test that detects Covid-19 antibodies, the company announced Monday.
Abbott said it plans to ship nearly 30 million tests this month and will have the capacity to ship 60 million tests in June. 
The tests can indicate whether a person has had Covid-19 and was either asymptomatic or recovered.

&gt;“Having more options of highly reliable tests across our platforms will help healthcare workers and health officials as they conduct broad scale testing for Covid-19,” Abbott CEO Robert Ford said in a statement.
The authorization means laboratories will be allowed to use the test even though it has not been formally approved or cleared by the FDA.
U.S. officials and corporations across America are pouring money into antibody testing, hoping it will give people the confidence to return to work and reopen parts of the economy. President Donald Trump has recommended states use the tests as they start relaxing some of the strict social distancing measures imposed to combat the pandemic, which has infected more than 1.3 million people across the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. 

&gt;Last week, the FDA tightened rules for coronavirus antibody tests, ordering manufacturers to submit emergency use authorization forms within 10 days.
Since the FDA issued its initial antibody test policy in mid-March, the agency said it has become aware of “a concerning number” of commercial serology tests being promoted inappropriately, including for diagnostic use, or performing poorly.

&gt;This is Abbott’s fourth Covid-19 test to win emergency use authorization. Abbott had already launched three coronavirus tests in the United States, including a rapid test that produces results in as little as five minutes and the newly released test that shows if a person has antibodies against the virus.
The company announced last month that it was working with CVS Health to get its tests “outside of the hospital” and into places like urgent-care clinics and nursing homes.

&gt;Abbott said the new test is more efficient and can provide more tests and take up less space, an important feature the company said for labs that process tens of thousands of patient samples but are often short on space.
It can exclude false positives 99.6% of the time and exclude false negatives 100% of the time for patients tested 14 days after symptoms began, the company said Monday.
It plans to submit for European CE mark approval this week.

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the FDA tightened rules for coronavirus antibody tests, ordering manufacturers to submit emergency use authorization forms within 10 days.
Since the FDA issued its initial antibody test policy in mid-March, the agency said it has become aware of “a concerning number” of commercial serology tests being promoted inappropriately, including for diagnostic use, or performing poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Abbott’s fourth Covid-19 test to win emergency use authorization. Abbott had already launched three coronavirus tests in the United States, including a rapid test that produces results in as little as five minutes and the newly released test that shows if a person has antibodies against the virus.
The company announced last month that it was working with CVS Health to get its tests “outside of the hospital” and into places like urgent-care clinics and nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbott said the new test is more efficient and can provide more tests and take up less space, an important feature the company said for labs that process tens of thousands of patient samples but are often short on space.
It can exclude false positives 99.6% of the time and exclude false negatives 100% of the time for patients tested 14 days after symptoms began, the company said Monday.
It plans to submit for European CE mark approval this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s up folks, $ABT seems to have risen from its bottom of $89.5 and is trending up at the moment. Accuracy is spot on, that article from April seems to have been disproved. Will see widespread use by other companies and firms by June and beyond I think.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"**Context:**

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater and quite a big name in the investment community, is currently writing a new book. In this book, he describes the rise and fall of empires and tries to model archetypical sequences of such events.

He is currently releasing chapters for free outlining the study and giving an introduction to the topic and some context to the important concepts he will later use. ([Link to articles](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/))

In the latest article, he is explaining the debt cycles and how they work.   


Short-term deb cycle: smaller economic expansions and contractions which typically last around 8 years.

Long-term debt cycle: big economic contractions and debt-restructuring like the great depression.

Video made by him explaining this much more eloquently than I ever could: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

**Main point:**

Reading through the article I stumbled upon this gem about when the long-term debt cycle is ending:

&gt;More specifically, the ability of central banks to be stimulative ends when the central bank loses its ability to produce money and credit growth that pass through the economic system to produce real economic growth.  

This is very much in line with what we are seeing right now. Asset prices go up but the economy is not really ""stimulated"".

BlackRock will steer as much as $750 billion into the corporate debt market for the Fed.

BlackRock is acting as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,” a firm spokesman said in a written statement.

I live in Southern California

Single as of now (meaning; no one to go in on property with)

Live at home and saving, looking to move out within the next few years.

Take home $2300 every 2 weeks = ~60k a year after taxes

2) continue saving for 3 to 4 more years and afford a house to live in of my own


Essentially it comes down to: use savings to buy rental property and use rental income to supplement my own or keep saving and eventually buy place of my own locally.

Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges

The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust their currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against the law for American citizens since 1935–luckily for them. In the past 35 years the price of gold in the open market has advanced from $35 an ounce to $48 in early 1972–a rise of only 35%. But during all this time the holder of gold has received no income return on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done better with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in the general price level.

The near-complete failure of hold to protect against a loss in the purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the ability of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by putting his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable objects have had striking advances in market value over the years—such as diamonds, paintings by masters, first editions of books, rare stamps, and counts, etc. But in many, perhaps most, of these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the precarious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is hard to think of paying $67,500 for a US silver dollar dated 1804 (but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.” We acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.

The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount of protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles. Finally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate means, except by various types of participation’s with others and with the special hazards that attach to new flotations— not too different from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All we should say to the investor is, “be sure it is yours before you go into it.”

,investing,"I've seen a lot of posts about how the market is too high and it doesn't make sense.  Here are some perspectives for why things are bad and should be down from January, but also why things aren't so bad that we should be at 2008 levels.

1.  About 75% of new unemployment is expected to be temporary.  This puts true unemployment levels at numbers that are obviously bad, but not 2008 level bad.
2.  Interest rates are at all time lows.  If you've taken a corporate finance class this would help explain the risk premium.  Assume most people see stocks as requiring an additional 5% return above the risk free rate.  If the risk free rate drops from 3% to 1%, your expected return from stocks drops from 8% to 6%.  When this happens, the price of stocks go up and not down.  To explain this, assume we have a company that only pays out 100% of profits as dividends.  Under the old normal, you'd pay $100 for a stock and expect $8 in dividends every year (an 8% return).  Now the question is, how much would you pay for the same stock if it earns -$8 this year and $8 per year after that, but you now demand only a 6% return.  The formula becomes $8 in perpetuity minus the immediate change for this year of $16 or $8/.06 - $16 = $117.33.  Obviously, these are made up numbers to illustrate a point.  That point is, prices go up when interest rates go down.  If you want to make the formula more complex, assume low interest rates for 5 years then back to the higher level after that, which may be more representative of the current environment.
3.  The Fed is backstopping everything.  What this essentially means is that the money printing machine in America is issuing loans.  If these loans are paid back, then the Fed will earn money on its investment and we will have deflation.  However, the Fed can simply print more money to help avoid deflation.  The other side of this equation, would be that the Fed invests poorly and loses money.  Now, we instead have inflation which the Fed can then stop printing money to a certain extent.  Assuming they lose grip and inflation becomes quite high, this is also good for most stocks, especially in a nominal sense.  Stocks are generally a decent inflation hedge, not the best, but decent.
4.  Government debt is also hitting new highs.  However, we are literally issuing debt at a rate lower than our targeted inflation number.  Of course the government could spend it in ways that do not contribute to the economy at all.  However, they need to do the bare minimum to provide out performance relative to the rates they will borrow at.
5.  Due to the combination of 3 and 4 above, it is unlikely there will be a massive liquidity issue.  These are where the market crashes really come into play.  If there is no one to provide money to people, then investors start demanding very high risk premiums because money becomes very high demand.  This would influence number 2 in the opposite direction and make stocks go down.  All in all, I believe a liquidity scenario is possible but very unlikely, which is why I advocate for at least putting a majority of your cash in the market instead of waiting for a pullback.  However, hold a little cash in case there is a larger market issue.
6.  Larger businesses represent a majority of the publicly traded companies.  However, small businesses are hurt the most from the current crisis.

,investing,"Yesterday I  listened to this very interesting podcast ( We Study Billionaires - TIP295: Mohnish Pabrai on Value Investing &amp; Philanthropy) where Mohnish Pabrai mentions what he calls secret compounders. The concept sounds very interesting to me, the company that compounds earnings like Visa or Mastercard, but doesn't demand the premium yet, since market doesn't know it yet. He mentions his investment in Fiat - Chrysler (FCAU) where he thought that Ferrari (RACE) alone is worth the whole company due to this reason. I have been thinking about it since yesterday, but I couldn't think of any. I also tried to identify some requirements for such a company.

1. Low P/E: goal is obviously to find the ones that haven't appreciated in value yet, since Mr. Market doesn't know about or doesn't value their compounding ability yet. So they have to have earnings and P/E multiple growth potential. If they have high P/E I can just buy V or MA, where I am sure of their copounding ability.
2. Addresable market that they dominate and is also growing, enabling the future growth of the company.
3. High operating and net margin that signal strong moat and ability to earn a lot of money which they then reinvest in the bussines.
4. Scalability without increasing costs; costs percentage should be decreasing considerably with scale. Something like Saas is the best representation of this.
5. Reinvested earnings are effective at raising revenue. If company is just investing a lot of money, but there is no growth, then they lack compounding ability imo (like IBM for example).

These are just a few points that I am not even sure that apply so I would like to get your opinion.

What criteria should we use to figure our if the company is a secret compunder? And do you have any ideas which companies would that be and why?

To me, the closest I could think of is Cisco (CSCO). They generate huge cash flow, have great balance sheet and pay nice and sustainable dividend. However, this doesn't make them a compunder, but just a nice company to invest in. Their shift from legacy business to Saas could make them one, but only if they are successful in making it a larger part of their revenue. This would increase their earnings power and also make their revenue more predictable, warranting P/E multiple expansion.

,investing,"Last week, we initiated a position in Springworks Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SWTX), and as promised, we’re providing our view on the company. 

**Summary:** Founded in 2017, Springworks is a $1.4B market cap biotech company developing targeted oncology therapies for rare tumor types with high unmet need. We like Springworks for several key reasons: 

* The company has two late-stage (Phase 2/3) programs, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, targeting rare tumor types with high unmet need (either insufficient therapies or no available therapies). Past trial data gives us confidence in their chances of approval, and we expect these candidates to be approved in 2022 and 2023 respectively, upon which they will become first-in-class drugs in their respective indications through their differentiated clinical profiles. 
* Springworks has signed collaborations with major biotech companies to develop several interesting early stage assets in additional oncology indications, providing a degree of validation of Springworks’ assets and creating a future growth runway. 
* We anticipate several value-creating milestones over the next year, namely topline data from nirogacestat’s registrational Phase 3 trial in mid-2021 and an interim update from mirdametinib’s registrational Phase 2b in 1Q21. 
* Our DCF analysis assigns Springworks a price target of $55, assuming an 85% probability of success for nirogacestat and mirdametinib in their main indications, and using an 11% discount rate and 2% terminal growth rate. 

**Company Background:** Springworks was established in 2017 as a spinoff from Pfizer, which provided the company with initial funding and the development rights to its 4 clinical assets. Springworks raised \~$230M from investors including Bain Capital and OrbiMed Advisors before going public in September 2019. 

**1. Late-stage Clinical Programs in Areas of High Unmet Need:** Springworks has two late stage programs currently in registrational or potentially registrational trials:

Nirogacestat. Nirogacestat is an oral, selective gamma secretase inhibitor developed to treat desmoid tumors. 

* *Desmoid tumors.* Desmoid tumors are highly morbid, soft tissue tumors with an estimated 6,000 patients being treated in the US every year. 
* *Unmet need.* Though survival rates for desmoid tumors are relatively high compared to other cancer types, desmoid tumors place a heavy burden on patients’ quality of life; they can interfere with the function of nearby structures (e.g. intestines), are painful to live with, and highly disfiguring. Treatment has traditionally been via surgical resection, but this method has been associated with recurrence rates of up to 70%. Chemotherapy and other targeted cancer therapies have been used off-label as well, but these have shown inconsistent efficacy and unfavorable safety profiles. 
* Nirogacestat has received FDA breakthrough and orphan drug designation.

Mirdametinib. Mirdametinib is an oral, selective MEK inhibitor developed to treat NF1-associate plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). 

* *NF1-PN.* The NF1 gene produces neurofibromin, a protein that represses a key signaling pathway (RAS/MAPK) responsible for the growth of many cancers. When the NF1 gene is mutated, the loss of neurofibromin production allows this pathway to run unchecked, resulting in tumor growth across the body. There are \~100k NF1 patients in the US, and 30-50% of these patients can develop plexiform neurofibromas, which are tumors that grow along nerves. 
* *Unmet need.* NF1-PN are associated with extreme pain and disfigurement as well as interference with neurocognitive function. First-line therapy is usually surgical resection, but NF1-PN extensive growth patterns along nerves make them hard to completely remove (while risking nerve damage). 
* There is one approved MEK inhibitor for NF1-PN, AstaZeneca’s selumetinib, which was approved in April 2020. While the drug works, mirdametinib has demonstrated a potentially superior safety profile vs. selumetinib, which should allow patients to remain on therapy longer and experience more clinical benefit. 
* Mirdametinib has received FDA orphan drug designation. 

**2. Promising Clinical Data.** 

Nirogacestat. To date, nirogacestat has shown a promising clinical profile in its Phase 1 and 2 trials. The drug is currently enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial, with progression free survival (PFS, a measure of how long patients live without their tumors growing &gt;20% in size) as the primary endpoint. 

* *Phase 1.* Nirogacestat achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 71.4% in its 7-patient Phase 1 trial (5/7), and a 100% disease control rate (DCR). Patients were able to stay on the drug for a median of 49.5 months (at the time of publication, so possibly longer), and none went off treatment due to safety issues. 
* *Phase 2.* In a heavily pre-treated population (median 4 lines of prior therapy vs. 3 in Phase 1 i.e. sicker patients), nirogacestat again achieved a 100% DCR and a 29.4% ORR. More importantly, 59% of patients remained on drug for more than 2 years. The drug was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to side effects. 
* *Phase 3.* A 115-patient Phase 3 trial is currently enrolling patients. The trial is powered to show a 12-month difference in PFS vs. placebo, and past trials from a similar drug showed that 50% of placebo patients experience disease progression by 8 months, which compares favorably to what nirogacestat has demonstrated in its Phase 1/2 trials. 
* The Phase 3 trial is expected to readout in 2Q/3Q21 and we expect approval of nirogacestat in 2022. 

Mirdametinib.  

* *Phase 2.* In its Phase 2 trial, Mirdametinib demonstrated a 42% ORR in 8/19 patients. In contrast, selumetinib demonstrated a 74% ORR in its Phase 2 trial. Though selumetinib’s Phase 2 data was numerically superior to mirdametinib’s, we believe several factors artificially limited mirdametinib’s efficacy:
   * Selumetinib’s trial enrolled only children while mirdametinib’s trial included only patients 16 years or older. Tumors in younger children are considered to be more responsive to therapy than those in adults. 
   * Patients in the mirdametinib trial were removed from the trial if they did not show signs of benefit within 12 months, which may have limited the number responses; 30% of selumetinib’s patients did not respond until after 12 months on drug. 
* *Safety benefits.* In its Phase 2, only 5 out of 19 patients (26%) required dose reductions of mirdametinib. In contrast, in selumetinib’s Phase 1, 10 out of 24 patients (42%) required dose reductions due to toxicity issues. We believe that this is evidence that mirdametinib is a safer drug than selumetinib, which will be an important differentiating factor for doctors deciding between the two drugs. 
* *Phase 2b.* Springworks is currently enrolling patients for a 100-patient Phase 2b trial of mirdametinib (primary endpoint ORR) that could support approval in 2023. The trial will enroll an even split of pediatric and adult patients and will not remove patients before 12 months. We expect that mirdametinib will show a similar ORR to selumetinib and differentiate itself via a superior safety profile. 

**3. Intriguing Early Stage Programs.**

* **Nirogacestat for Multiple Myeloma Therapy.** Nirogacestat is also being evaluated as an add-on therapy to BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells with \~27k patients in the US every year. These drugs target a protein called BCMA on the surface of cancer cells, and preclinical data has shown that nirogacestat significantly upregulates the expression of BCMA on cancer cells and enhanced the potency of BCMA-targeting drugs. Springworks has already signed collaborations with Glaxo Smith Kline and Allogene Therapeutics to use nirogacestat in combination trials with their BCMA drugs. 
* **BGB-3245.** Springworks has also signed a collaboration agreement with Beigene, a leading China biotech company, to develop a novel cancer drug targeting BRAF-mutant solid tumors. BRAF is a validated oncology target that is clinically relevant in melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. BGB-3245 has been shown in preclinical models to be effective in inhibiting certain mutant forms of BRAF that currently approved BRAF inhibitors cannot target. A Phase 1 trial for BGB-3245 has been initiated in Australia. 

**4. Strong Balance Sheet:** As of the end of 2019, Springworks had \~$330M in cash and no debt. This is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and support its 6 clinical trials through the end of 2022. The company has not indicated that its clinical development timelines have been impacted by Covid, but we will be on the lookout for any future guidance. 

**5. Experienced Leadership:** Springworks is led by a world-class management team with deep pharma industry experience. Selected leadership includes:

* Chief Executive Officer Saqib Islam is a founding member of the company and was formerly the Chief Business Officer at Moderna. Prior to Moderna, he held senior leadership roles at Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a $20B rare disease biotech).
* Chief Medical Officer Jens Renstrup was formerly Head of Medical Affairs at Alexion, where he was instrumental in building out its pipeline. Prior to Alexion, he led medical affairs at Glaxo Smith Kline’s vaccine division. 
* Head of R&amp;D Stephen Squinto is a venture partner at OrbiMed, a highly respected life science investment firm. He is also a co-founder of Alexion, where he led global operations and R&amp;D for over 20 years. 

**6. Risks.** Potential investors should be aware that Springworks is exposed to the following key risks as a biotech company:

* *Clinical development risk.* Springworks’ assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. 
* *Competitive risk.* Springworks’ drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. 
* *Financial risk.* Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical development risk.&lt;/em&gt; Springworks’ assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competitive risk.&lt;/em&gt; Springworks’ drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial risk.&lt;/em&gt; Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down. &lt;/li&gt;
